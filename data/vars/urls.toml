# `curl -L "iguazio-sample-data.s3.amazonaws.com/<file path>" > /v3io/<target data-container path>`
# See specifically the relevant section in the tutorial NBs - product.toml
# ver.jupyter_notebook.tutorials.data_ingestion_and_preparation.basic_nb - and
# the related product data variables and internal info, such as the
# sample_csv_aws_file and sample_csv_aws_rel_path map keys.
# The Zeppelin getting-started example currently still uses a file from a
# third-party repo; previously we used the deutsche-boerse public data set,
# but currently it uses https://s3.amazonaws.com/apache-zeppelin/ - see the
# ver.zeppelin.predef_notes.getting_started.sample_csv_aws_url product
# data-variable map key. Note that in the Zeppelin example we provide the full
# URL in the curl command while in the Jupyter Notebook examples we only use
# the "base" URL key (the part after "https://" in the bucket URL?
#
# See also the amazon_s3_open_data_sets_reg URL data variable.
#
# [c-aws-data-set-browse] I you use the URL, you see a text file that's hard to
# decipher. Adi explained that you can get information about the available data
# sets by using Amazon's S3 Browser tool (http://s3browser.com/) or by issuing
# an Amazon S3 GET Bucket request
# (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/v2-RESTBucketGET.html).
# S3 Browser is a desktop add and I wasn't able to use it to browse public
# data sets without entering AWS account info.
# I was able to issue a GET Bucket request with Postman. However, even though
# the response set the "IsTruncated" parameter to "true", indicating there are
# more results to get with another request, I didn't find a
# "NextContinuationToken" param in the response, which is required to issue
# another request with the "continuation-token" request parameter set to the
# returned token from the previous request to retrieve additional results.

# has docs for v6.0.3, and docs for older v4 and v5 releases, including the
# v5.7.4 release that's used in our v2.3.1- docs. I'm guessing they stopped
# maintaining versions-specific URLs for all releases of the current major
# stable release (currently, v6) and that the old v6.0.1 doc link will once
# again work when the stable version is updated, but I don't want the docs to
# rely on this + I don't want to have to fix broken links if they later remove

# VMware vSphere documentation for the latest supported platform version
# [IntInfo] [InfraInfo] (sharonl) (11.11.20) Use this as the base URL for
# linking to a specific page in the vSphere documentation, but use vsphere_docs
# to link to this documentation in general. The vSphere documentation has
# versioned-doc links in the navigation menu, but it doesn't allow selecting
# the base link for each version; the base versioned-doc URL that I derived
# from the URLs of specific versioned pages shows the versioned-docs home page
# with an HTML TOC, but ti's not a full doc site like the non-versioned URL.
# [TODO-NEW-VER] [c-vsphere-ver] When the latest supported VMware vSphere
# version changes (see `ver.vmware` in the product.toml), also update this URL.
