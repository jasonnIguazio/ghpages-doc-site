<!-- Params
  Mandatory Params
  "ctx"   - The context of the calling template/partial/shortcode (`.`).
  Optional Params
  "text"  - Beta notation text. Default = .Site.Params.beta_mark when "mark",
            "note", or "heading" is "1"; otherwise, .Site.Params.beta or
            .Site.Params.beta if "tc"=1.
  "tc"    - 1 = Use .Site.Params.beta_tc (title case) and not .Site.Params.beta
            (lower case) as the default text (see "text").
  "mark"  - 1 = use .Site.Params.beta_mark as the default beta notation text.
            This is also the default notation text when "note" or "heading" is
            "1". "mark" is ignored when "text" is set.
  "fmt"   - 1 (default) = apply "beta" CSS formatting; 0 - don't apply special
            formatting. If "note" or "heading" is "1", "fmt" is ignored.
  "basic_desc" - 1 = add a basic description of beta features
            (.Site.Params.beta_basic_desc). Note that the call to the shortcode
            with this option needs to be preceded by the beginning of the first
            description sentence (which begins with "included").
  "heading" - 1 = add the beta notation as a small heading (<p>).
            If "note" is "1", "fmt" is ignored.
  "note"  - 1 = add a beta note. The content of the note depends on whether the
            "feature" or "features" param is set (betaFeature/betaFeatures in
            the page front matter); and whether the entire page or section
            documents a beta feature, as indicated by the custom isBeta,
            betaFeature, or betaFeatures page params.
            If "note" is "1", "fmt" is ignored.
            The default note text explains the beta notation, which is
            determined based on the user of the "text" and "mark" params, and
            the notation is formatted using the "beta" CSS class regardless of
            the value of "fmt".
  "feature" Custom text describing a beta feature, to be used in beta notes.
            This param can be set from the page front matter using the custom
            betaFeature page param.
  "features" Like "feature" but describes a plural beta feature (e.g., "APIs").
            This param can be set from the page front matter using the custom
            betaFeatures page param.
  [*] [InfraInfo] [sharonl] The optional "text" param was added so that if we
  decide to change the beta text/mark, we can change the shortcode calls in
  documents that shouldn't be modified retroactively, such as release notes, to
  pass within the "text" param the $.Site.Params.beta[_mark] string that was
  used when the release notes were published (i.e., before the changes).
  Regarding the beta class formatting, I think it's less of an issue if we
  change it retroactively, but if we decide to change the formatting and want
  to keep the original format in the existing release notes we can add support
  for this as well. We can also always replace existing shortcode calls with
  hardcoded text.
