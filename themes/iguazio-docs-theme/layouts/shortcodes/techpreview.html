<!-- Params (Optional)
  "text"  - Tech-preview notation text. Default = .Site.Params.techpreview_mark
            when "mark", "note", or "heading" is "1"; otherwise,
            .Site.Params.techpreview or .Site.Params.techpreview_tc if "tc"=1.
  "tc"    - 1 = Use .Site.Params.techpreview_tc (title case) and not
            .Site.Params.techpreview (lower case) as the default text (see
            "text").
  "mark"  - 1 = use .Site.Params.techpreview_mark as the default tech-preview
            notation text. This is also the default notation text when "note"
            or "heading" is "1". "mark" is ignored when "text" is set.
  "fmt"   - 1 (default) = apply "tech-preview" CSS formatting; 0 - don't apply
            special formatting. If "note" or "heading" is "1", "fmt" is ignored.
  "basic_desc" - 1 = add a basic description of Tech Preview features
            (.Site.Params.techpreview_basic_desc). Note that the call to the
            shortcode with this option needs to be preceded by the beginning of
            the first description sentence (which begins with "included").
  "heading" - 1 = add the tech-preview notation as a small heading (<p>).
            If "note" is "1", "fmt" is ignored.
  "note"  - 1 = add a Tech Preview note. The content of the note depends on
            whether the "feature" or "features" param is set
            (techpreviewFeature/techpreviewFeatures in the page front matter);
            and whether the entire page or section documents a Tech Preview
            feature, as indicated by the custom isTechPreview,
            techpreviewFeature, or techpreviewFeatures page params.
            If "note" is "1", "fmt" is ignored.
            The default note text explains the Tech Preview notation, which is
            determined based on the user of the "text" and "mark" params, and
            the notation is formatted using the "techpreview" CSS class
            regardless of the value of "fmt".
  "note_text" - Like "note" but only for the note text without the admonition.
  "feature" Custom text describing a Tech Preview feature, to be used in
            Tech Preview notes. This param can be set from the page front
            matter using the custom techpreviewFeature page param.
  "features" Like "feature" but describes a plural Tech Preview feature (e.g.,
            "APIs"). This param can be set from the page front matter using the
            custom techpreviewFeatures page param.
  [*] [InfraInfo] [sharonl] The optional "text" param was added so that if we
  decide to change the tech-preview text/mark, we can change the shortcode
  calls in documents that shouldn't be modified retroactively, such as release
  notes, to pass within the "text" param the $.Site.Params.techpreview[_mark]
  string that was used when the release notes were published (i.e., before the
  changes). Regarding the tech-preview class formatting, I think it's less of
  an issue if we change it retroactively, but if we decide to change the
  formatting and want to keep the original format in the existing release notes
  we can add support for this as well. We can also always replace existing
  shortcode calls with hardcoded text.
