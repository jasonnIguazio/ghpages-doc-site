<!-- Include a file from another content page (for code reuse).
  Mandatory Params - You must provide either "f" or "f_datavar":
    "f"     - Relative path to the file to include within the includes dir
              (see the "d" param). Ignored if "f_datavar" is set.
    "f_datavar" - A .Site.Data.vars variable for the relative file path.
  Optional Params
    "d"     - The root includes directory. Default = .Site.Params.includes_dir
              or .Site.Params.test_includes_dir if "t" = "test" (for tests).
              Ignored if "d_datavar" is set.
    "d_datavar" - A .Site.Data.vars variable for the directory path.
    "t"     - Includes type - "" (default) or "test" for internal infra tests.
              This param is used to set the default root includes directory
              (see the "d" param) and is ignored when the "d" param is set.

[InfraIfo]
- [ci-include-file-metadata] Begin included MD files with a metadata section,
  even if it's empty (i.e., two lines with three hyphens in each); otherwise,
  shortcode calls (such as `comment`) or HTML comments at the start of the file
  (before any text) produce a runtime Hugo build error: "invalid character '{'
  looking for beginning of object key string for <include path>".
  (21.6.20) This is still true with Hugo v0.57.2.
- Referencing .Page.Params.<param> from within an inline shortcode in the
  included file references the metadata in the front matter of the included file
  only (if exists) and not of the including file.
