<!-- Untested v1.7.0 RESOLVED/DONE Issues -->
{{< internal-release-note title="Untested v1.7.0 RESOLVED/DONE Issues" id="doc-pending-qa-tests" >}}
- The following **bugs** were **resolved as Fixed** for v1.7.0 but the fix was **not verified by QA**.
  Per Adi's guidelines, **I kept the related known-issues notes** and will only move them to the _Fixes_ section after QA verify the fix:

    - **[Unsupported HDFS commands](#ig-3106)** for Bug {{< jira ig="3106" >}}.
    - **[<api>DescribeStream</api> returns info also for unauthorized users](#ig-4021)** for Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}}.

    There are also **enhancements and new features** that **weren't tested by QA** and therefore **aren't included in the RNs**:

    - {{< jira ig="4460" >}} &mdash; new dashboard <gui-title>Task Report</gui-title>.
      According to Meir, the Task Report feature wasn't included in the v1.7.0 UI (because it wasn't tested).
    - {{< jira ig="5114" >}} &mdash; support **incremental backups**.
    - {{< jira ig="6469" >}} &mdash; increase the **maximum attribute size** to **1 MB**.
      <br/>
      (24.6.18) UPDATE: Ori wrote in this v1.7.0 RNs review &mdash; "large attr support was disabled by default in the release, it will be opened for selected customers that use the tsdb (mixing 2 features which are tech preview ?)".
      ==&gt; this enhancement didn't make it into the official v1.7.0 release.

    I labeled such tickets in JIRA as `doc-pending-qa-tests` (query = [labels in (doc-pending-qa-tests)](https://jira.iguazeng.com/issues/?jql=labels in (doc-pending-qa-tests))).

<!-- New Features and Enhancements -->
{{< rn-heading t="new-and-enhance" >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="new-general" >}}General{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Increased the maximum connections per cluster to 350.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7404" type="subreq" owner="Gilad B. (giladb)" id="ig-7404" >}}
(sharonl) (18.7.18) (Post-Release Note) For the v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA) release, Orit and Adi agreed to Nir's request (supported by Maor) to remove the maximum connections per cluster information from our external doc (documented since v1.5 in the SW specs & restrictions doc), and therefore this RN was also not included in the v1.7.1 RNs.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Updated the compilation of the big-data libraries (such as Spark and Presto) to Java 8.

    {{< internal-release-note id="big-data-java8" >}}
(sharonl) (26.6.18) This note was added at Golan's request after the initial v1.7.0 Equinix Early Edition RNs publication.
<br/>
Golan couldn't refer to a related JIRA ticket.
(18.7.18) (Post-Release Note) This note was slightly rephrased in the v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA) RNs.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added the following open-source third-party applications and related support to the default platform installation:

    - [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) data warehouse software (version 2.1.1) and a custom Iguazio Hive Metastore for seamlessly sharing a data catalog across multiple applications and defining relational tables and views.
      {{< internal-release-note ig="6286" type="req" owner="Assaf Leibovitch (assafl)" docig="7287" id="ig-6286" >}}
      {{< /internal-release-note >}}
    - [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) platform for analytics and monitoring (version 5.0.4) {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.
      The platform comes with predefined Grafana dashboard for monitoring the application nodes.
      {{< internal-release-note ig="7673" type="req" owner="Evgeny (evegenyr)" docig="7751" id="ig-7673" >}}
      {{< /internal-release-note >}}
    - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) systems monitoring and alerting toolkit (version 2.0.0) {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.
      {{< internal-release-note id="ig-new-prometheus" >}}
**DOC Task:** {{< jira ig="8024" >}}
      {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Raised the versions and related support for the following pre-deployed open-source third-party applications:

    - [Apache Zeppelin](https://hadoop.apache.org) web-based notebook {{< techpreview mark="1" >}} &mdash; version 0.7.3
    - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) machine-intelligence (MI) library {{< techpreview mark="1" >}} &mdash; version 1.4.0
    - See also the supported [Spark](#new-spark) and [Hadoop](#new-hadoop) version updates in the dedicated enhancements sections.

    {{< internal-release-note docig="8024" id="ig-8024-raise-app-versions" >}}
**Confluence"** [Support Matrix](http://confluence.iguazeng.com:8090/display/SR/Support+Matrix)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added a built-in process that uses Presto SQL to create a Hive view that monitors both real-time data in the platform's NoSQL store and historical data in Parquet tables {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7066" type="req" owner="Avi (avia)" docig="8018" id="ig-7066" >}}
(sharonl) This note refers to Parquez but it was established that users don't need to be aware of the tool name.
Users will use the related CLI script, which is currently named <file>run_parquez</file> but the name might change.
I agreed with Adi that for the v1.7 GA release we'll need to decide on an external name for this tool.
<br/>
Adi said not to mention in the RN the use of the Iguazio Hive Metastore.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added global back-pressure support for the big-data libraries.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4227" type="req" owner="Golan (golans)" id="ig-4227" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="new-expressions" >}}Condition and Update Expressions{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Added support for using array attributes in condition expressions {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5113" type="req" owner="GalS. (gals)" docig="6857" id="ig-5113-arr-attr-in-condition-expressions" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (25.6.18) IG-5113 was opened for the official support of array attributes in update expressions in v1.7.0.
Initially, we planed to add a related RN + document official support for using array attributes in NoSQL Web API `PutItem` filter expressions and as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} in other types of condition expressions (see more info in DOC IG-6857).
However, R&D, QA, and Adi later concluded that the support for arrays in expressions isn't stable enough for official support in v1.7.0.
Therefore, I only added a RN for the new {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} support for the use of array attributes in condition expressions (in general); the {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} use of array attributes in update expressions was already documented in the v1.5.0 RNs.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added a <func>length</func> function for calculating the size of a string.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5023" owner="Gal S. (gals)" docig="5987" id="ig-5023-7458-length" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Extended the support for using array and blob attributes in expressions {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}:

    - Added support for using the addition operator (`+`) to concatenate arrays and array slices.
    - Added <func>find</func>, <func>find_all_indices</func>, <func>extract_by_indices</func>, and <func>sort</func> functions for arrays and array slices.
    - Added a <func>blob</func> function for defining blobs from Base64 encoded strings and creating blob attributes. 
    - Added a <func>length</func> function for calculating the size of an array or array slice.
    - Added a <func>sum</func> function for summing up the values of all elements in an array or array slice.

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-7458" >}}
**R&D Issues:** Requirement {{< jira ig="7458" >}}; Task {{< jira ig="7458" >}} (<func>length</func> for arrays); Improvement {{< jira ig="5023" >}} (<func>sum</func>)<br/>
**Owner:** Gal S. (gals)<br/>
**DOC Issues:** Sub-Requirement {{< jira ig="7462" >}}; Sub-Requirement {{< jira ig="5987" >}} (<func>length</func>); Task {{< jira ig="5470" >}} (<func>sum</func>)<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) (25.6.18) The <func>sum</func> function and the use of the <func>length</func> function with arrays were tested and verified by QA (Sagi) for v1.7.0.
However, just before the v1.7.0 release, R&D, QA, and Adi decided not to officially support in v1.7.0 the use of arrays in expressions (previously supported as Tech Preview for update expressions) &mdash; see the info for {{< jira ig="5113" >}} and for the condition-expression array {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} support note above.
Therefore, I moved the official-support <func>sum</func> and <func>length</func> for arrays notes that I prepared to the arrays {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} note.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- See also the new [<api>UpdateItem</api>](#UpdateItem-AlternateUpdateExpression) NoSQL Web API option to perform if-else conditional updates.

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="new-web-apis" >}}Web APIs{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub id="new-nosql-web-api" >}}NoSQL Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

- <a id="nosql-web-api-range-scan"></a> <api>GetItems</api> now has optional <paramname>ShardingKey</paramname>, <paramname>SortKeyRangeStart</paramname>, and <paramname>SortKeyRangeEnd</paramname> parameters to support faster range scans that scan only for items within a specific range of sort-key attribute values {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5123" type="req" owner="Ori (orim)" docig="7260" id="ig-5123" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) See also the similar [Spark](#spark-range-scan) and [Presto](#presto-range-scan) notes.
<br/>
(25.6.18) This feature is supported in v1.7.0 only as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} because it wasn't tested by QA.
<br/>
In this version, the sort-key based range scan is supported only for string attributes (because of the use of a lexicographic sorting order), but I didn't think it was necessary to mention this in the release notes.
It will be documented in the SW specs & restrictions doc and the relevant references.
<br/>
Initially I phrased the note to emphasize the option of performing faster primary-key based scans as a separate feature than range scans &mdash; because users can set the sharding key without setting the start and end sort-key range values (i.e., not really a range scan) to perform a faster scan by attribute file names instead of an actual table scan.
However, Ori and Adi said they consider this as part of the "range-scan" feature and Adi preferred that we only refer to "range scan" in the release notes.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="UpdateItem-AlternateUpdateExpression"></a> <api>UpdateItem</api> now has an optional <paramname>AlternateUpdateExpression</paramname> request parameter to support an if-else conditional-update logic.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6277" type="req" owner="Gal S. (gals)" docig="6805" id="ig-6277" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="new-spark" >}}Spark{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Added support for [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) version 2.2.1 and stopped the support for version 1.6.3.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5134" type="req" owner="Golan (golans)" docig="5674" id="ig-5134" >}}
**Confluence"** [Support Matrix](http://confluence.iguazeng.com:8090/display/SR/Support+Matrix)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub id="new-spark-nosql-df" >}}Spark NoSQL DataFrame{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

- Added automatic inference of NoSQL table schemas {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6602" type="req" owner="Golan (golans)" docig="7098" id="ig-6602-spark" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (11.7.18) We added support for an `inferSchema` option (similar to the built-in option that already exists, for example, to the Spark DF CSV data source).
&ndash;> **<font color="red">TODO-DOC</font>** In the v1.7 GA RNs, rephrase this note similar to the Presto phrasing:
> Added support for automatic inference of NoSQL table schemas {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added a <api>&quot;condition&quot;</api> option for performing conditional updates.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6185" type="req" owner="Or Z. (orz)" docig="7406" id="ig-6185" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added a <api>&quot;partition&quot;</api> option for partitioning of NoSQL tables {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6114" type="req" owner="Golan (golans)" docig="6629" id="ig-6114" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="spark-range-scan"></a>Added support for faster range scans that scan only for items within a specific range of sort-key attribute values {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7422" type="req" docig="7459" owner="Golan (golans)" id="ig-7422-spark" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) See also the similar [NoSQL Web API](#nosql-web-api-range-scan) and [Presto](#presto-range-scan) notes.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added support for the timestamp data type (<api>TimestampType</api>).

    {{< internal-release-note owner="Golan (golan)" id="spark-nosql-df-timestamp" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (26.6.18) This note was added, at Golan's request, after the initial publication of the v1.7.0 Equinix Early Edition RNS.
<br/>
Golan couldn't refer to a related JIRA ticket.
<br/>
Vadim verified that QA tested this, and Golan and I also saw that QA opened some related bugs that were fixed (unlike the similar [Presto](#presto-timestamp) timestamp support, which wasn't tested for v1.7.0).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub id="new-spark-streaming-integration-api" >}}Spark-Streaming Integration API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

- Added Java and Python Spark-Streaming Integration APIs {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}, similar to the existing Scala API.
  Public code examples that previously used a preliminary unofficial version of the Python API were updated to accommodate v1.7.0 improvements to the API.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7957" type="req" owner="Golan (golans)" docig="7946" id="ig-7957-python" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) The Python API existed also in earlier releases but was intentionally not documented until its alignment with the Scala API, which was done in v1.7.0.
However, the undocumented Python API was used in public code examples in the [v3io](https://github.com/v3io) GitHub repo &mdash; for example, in the [taxi_streaming](https://github.com/v3io/iguazio_api_examples/blob/master/taxi_streaming/) ride-hailing API code example, which was documented in the Development Quick-Start guide (**tutorials/latest-release/getting-started/development-qs.md**).
<br/>
(25.6.18) Because QA didn't test the Java and Python APIs, Adi decided to document them as Tech Preview.
<br/>
(18.7.18) (Post-Release Note) In the v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA) RNs, we removed the Java reference because R&D (Golan) weren't be able to provide me with the required info for documenting this API in time for v1.7.1.
I opened a separate v1.9.0 Java DOC ticket &mdash; DOC {{< jira ig="8590" >}} and marked it as reuqiring a future RN when the API is ready for documentation.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Renamed the Scala <func>V3IOUtils.createDirectStream</func> <paramname>topicNames</paramname> parameter to <paramname>streamNames</paramname>.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7957" type="req" owner="Golan (golans)" docig="7946" id="ig-7957-scala" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Consolidated the <api>container-alias</api> and <api>container-id</api> configuration properties into a single <api>container-id</api> property that can receive either a container-name (alias) string or a numeric container ID.

    {{< internal-release-note owner="Igor (igorm)" docig="7530" id="ig-7530" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) Igor said there was no R&D JIRA ticket for this change.
He referred to _zeek_ [PR #1021](https://github.com/iguazio/zeta/pull/1021).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added support for seek by time (search for stream records by their ingestion time) via the new <api>spark.streaming.v3io.streamStartPosition</api> and <api>spark.streaming.v3io.streamStartTimeMS</api> configuration properties.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5929" type="req" owner="Igor (igorm)" docig="6833" id="ig-5929" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="new-presto" >}}Presto{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Added official support for using [Presto](https://prestodb.io/) (version 0.189), a distributed SQL query engine for big data (previously supported as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}}), which is included as part of  the default platform installation.
    In this version, the platform supports only <cmd>SELECT</cmd> queries over its NoSQL database.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4247" type="req" owner="Golan (golans)" docig="7407" id="ig-4247" >}}
<br/>
  (sharonl) (Info from Dina) When using Presto with AWS EMR (as done by Grab, for example), the Presto version is that of the EMR.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added support for automatic inference of NoSQL table schemas {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6602" type="req" owner="Golan (golans)" docig="7098" id="ig-6602-presto" >}}
(sharonl) (26.6.18) I rephrased this note after the initial publication of the v1.7.0 Equinix Early Edition release notes to add "support for" after Golan explained that unlike Spark DataFrames, in Presto the user needs to select to activate the automatic schema inference via a Presto CLI command.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="presto-range-scan"></a>Added support for faster range scans that scan only for items within a specific range of sort-key attribute values {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7422" type="req" docig="7459" owner="Golan (golans)" id="ig-7422-presto" >}}
(sharonl) See also the similar [NoSQL Web API](#nosql-web-api-range-scan) and [Spark](#spark-range-scan) notes.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added support for the timestamp data type {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note owner="Golan (golan)" id="presto-timestamp" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (26.6.18) This note was added, at Golan's request, after the initial publication of the v1.7.0 Equinix Early Edition RNS.
<br/>
Golan couldn't refer to a related JIRA ticket.
<br/>
The feature was marked as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} because it wasn't tested for v1.7.0 by QA (unlike the similar [Spark NMoSQL DataFrame](#spark-nosql-df-timestamp) feature).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="new-hadoop" >}}Hadoop{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Added support for [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) version 2.9.0.

    {{< internal-release-note docig="8024" id="ig-8024-hadoop" >}}
**Confluence"** [Support Matrix](http://confluence.iguazeng.com:8090/display/SR/Support+Matrix)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Accelerated recursive file and directory deletion using [<cmd>hadoop fs</cmd>](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.9.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html) commands (<nobr>`hadoop fs -rm -r`</nobr> or <nobr>`hadoop fs -rmdir <directory>`</nobr>).

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7197" type="imp" owner="Gal T. (galt)" id="ig-7197" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (25.6.18) Adi and Ori decided not to document this as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} even though the feature wasn't tested by QA.
Ori said users can't avoid using this feature, and Adi said that users are already using it and we can't say now that we don't officially support this.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added support for the  <cmd>truncate</cmd> Hadoop (`hdfs`) command {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3106" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" fixver="1.7.0" owner="Tal N. (taln)" id="ig-3106" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (20.6.18) In previous release notes (since v1.7.0), the known issue for [unsupported `hdfs` commands](#hdfs-unsupported-cmds) included the <cmd>truncate</cmd> command and was associated with Bug {{< jira ig="3106" >}} to implement the <cmd>truncate</cmd> command.
In v1.7.0, Bug 3106 and duplicate Bug {{< jira ig="5239" >}} were fixed, so I moved the <cmd>truncate</cmd> reference to an enhancement note (I decided not to document this as a fix) and I disassociated the unsupported-commands known issue from Bug 3106.
Because the new <cmd>truncate</cmd> support wasn't tested by QA for v1.7.0, it was decided, in consultation with Adi and Golan, to document this as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}}.
The changes were done after the initial publication of the v1.7.0 Equinix Early Edition release notes.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="new-ha" >}}High Availability (HA){{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Added support for failover: in the event of a system failure, the platform can maintain the availability of the service.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4214" type="req" owner="Oded (odedm)" docig="7317" id="ig-4214" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (20.6.18) Support for HA with failover was added in v1.5.0 but owning to multiple bugs we decided to document for v1.5.0 only the support for no-SPOF and document the support for failover as a new v1.7.0 feature.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="new-security-n-user-management" >}}Security and User Management{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- <a id="new-multi-tenancy"></a> Added support for multiple tenants ("multi-tenancy"):

(sharonl) (25.6.18) Adi said not to mark this as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} feature, even though it wasn't tested by QA in time for v1.7.0, because "it's not a typical customer facing feature".
<br/>
Nir Sagi explained that previously, we didn't know whether a specific cluster was inactive because of a problem or because it was just not being used.
In v1.7.0, we added platform "heartbeats" &mdash; the platform periodically reports that "it's alive" to the service center, which is controlled by Maor's support team.

The following issues were fixed in the current release:

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="fixes-expressions" >}}Condition and Update Expressions{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- When the <func>min</func>, <func>max</func>, <func>starts</func>, <func>ends</func>, or <func>contains</func> expression function receives too many arguments, the operation is skipped and the function doesn't return an error.
    In v1.7.0, the function returns a 400 error.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6086" type="bug" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.5.3" fixver="1.7.0" id="ig-6086" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (27.3.18) The description in Bug IG-6086 refers to a crash and the fix version is only 1.7.0.
However, Gal S. told me that in **v1.5.0&ndash;1.5.2**, passing too many arguments to the <func>min</func>, <func>max</func>, <func>starts</func>, <func>ends</func>, or <func>contains</func> expression functions caused a VN crash, and that this was fixed in **v1.5.3** (even though the fix version for Bug IG-6086 is only v1.7.0).
Gal said that in **v1.5.3** there's no crash but we still don't validate the number of arguments and when passing too many arguments the operation is skipped and no error is returned; this was fixed in **v1.7.0**.
Sagi told me he only tested the behavior in v1.7.0, and he verified that in this version the function returns a 400 error.
(He didn't test too few arguments but has now made a note to add such tests.)
In consultation with Adi, I didn't add a Fixes note for the undocumented VN crash bug that was fixed in v1.5.3.

When moving the previously known issue to the Fixes section for the v1.7.0 RNs, I removed the following info from the previous RNs known issue:

> Note that when using the <paramname>Key</paramname> parameter, the platform automatically creates a matching user attribute for you.

<br/>
(sharonl) Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made.
<br/>
(24.2.18) After speaking with Gilad, it turns out that we now have v1.7.0 Task {{< jira ig="5346" >}} **"eliminate container handle semantics in v3io ..."** for supporting only container names and removing the support for container IDs (handles).
(17.6.18) {{< jira ig="5346" >}} is still planned for v1.7.0 with Status ICEBOX.
I asked Liat and Gilad, in a [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-5346?focusedCommentId=32735&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-32735) in this ticket, whether it shouldn't be re-planned for v1.9.0 and maybe changed to a Requirement or Sub-Requirement.

(8.1.18) The bug occurs also with our Scala/Java Streaming API &mdash; <api>V3IOStreamingOperations.describeStream</api>, defined in <path>v3io-streaming/src/main/scala/io/iguaz/v3io/streaming/V3IOStreamingOperations.scala</path> in the `zeta` repo.
However, at Golan's request, this API is not documented or mentioned in the release notes until we align our APIs, so I restricted the v1.5.x known issue to the documented <api>DescribeStream</api> web operation.

  Note that the correct usage capacity for each container can be viewed in the container-page overview.

- The EMR cluster can be used only with the default tenant.

(sharonl) (20.6.18) Vadim said that the EMR can be used with the default tenant regardless of whether additional platform tenants are defined.

- The EMR cluster uses a single node, resulting in limited redundancy.

- Removed the [Sparkling Water](https://www.h2o.ai/sparkling-water/) library for integrating H2O.ai with Apache Spark from the default platform installation.

    {{< internal-release-note docig="8166" id="ig-8166" >}}
(sharonl) (20.6.18) Sparkling Water was removed from the default installation because the version that we previously installed and tested is no longer supported.
I don't know of an R&D/DevOps JIRA ticket for the removal from the default installation.
We plan to test a later version and return it to the platform installation in a future product release but Adi said not to specify this in the RNs.

- Platform start-up, restart, and shut-down should be coordinated with the Iguazio support team.

    {{< internal-release-note docig="5829" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (2.4.18) Adi requested that we add this in the release notes (starting with the v1.5.3 RNs, even though it's also true for earlier versions).
