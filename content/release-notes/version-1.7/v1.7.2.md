<!-- Untested RESOLVED/DONE Issues -->
{{< internal-release-note title="Untested RESOLVED/DONE Issues" id="doc-pending-qa-tests" >}}
The following issues are done by R&D but not tested by QA.
The issues are labeled in JIRA as `doc-pending-qa-tests` (query = [labels in (doc-pending-qa-tests)](https://jira.iguazeng.com/issues/?jql=labels in (doc-pending-qa-tests))).

- **Bugs resolved as Fixed** for v1.7.0 or v1.7.1 but the fix was **not verified by QA**.
  Per Adi's guidelines, **I kept the related known-issues notes** and will only move them to the _Fixes_ section after QA verify the fix:

    - **[<api>DescribeStream</api> returns info also for unauthorized users](#ig-4021)** for Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}}.
      (See also the open question regarding the description of this known issue.)

- **Enhancements and new features** that **weren't tested by QA** and therefore **aren't included in the RNs** (not even as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}}):

  - {{< jira ig="5114" >}} &mdash; support **incremental backups**.
  - {{< jira ig="6469" >}} &mdash; increase the **maximum attribute size** to **1 MB**.
    <br/>
    (24.6.18) UPDATE: Ori wrote in this v1.7.0 RNs review &mdash; "large attr support was disabled by default in the release, it will be opened for selected customers that use the tsdb (mixing 2 features which are tech preview ?)".
    ==&gt; this enhancement didn't make it into the official v1.7.0 release.
{{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- //////////////////////////////////////// -->
<!-- Fixes -->
{{< rn-heading t="fixes" >}}

The following issues were fixed in the current release:

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="fixes-security" >}}Security{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Deny-all data-access policy rules overpower other rules.
  In v1.7.2, the data-access policy rules processing was fixed, subject to [known issues](#ki-security).

    {{< internal-release-note ig="8140" type="bug" owner="Roy B. (royb)" fixver="1.7.2" id="ig-8140" >}}

<!-- Known Issues -->
{{< rn-heading t="known-issues" >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-backup-n-recovery" >}}Backup and Recovery{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Stream data is not backed up and restored as part of the platform's backup and upgrade operations.

    {{< internal-release-note ki_start_ver="1.5.1" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (13.2.18) Adi requested that we document this as a known issue in the RNs even though this behavior is by design and currently there's no plan to change it.
This will also be documented in the software specifications and restrictions document (DOC Task {{< jira ig="3582" >}}).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-ha" >}}High Availability (HA){{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- The automatic execution of the system-failure recovery process might result in duplicated data for streaming and simple-object data-append operations or duplicated execution of update expressions.

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-4887-7790" >}}
**Bugs:** {{< jira ig="4887" >}} (streaming & S3 data append); {{< jira ig="7790" >}} (update expressions)<br/>
**Owner:** Gilad (giladb)<br/>
Known issue since RN v1.5.0 for Bug {{< jira ig="4887" >}} and since RN v1.7.0 for Bug {{< jira ig="7790" >}}.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- I/O requests might fail during failover.

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-6475-6246" >}}
**Bugs:** {{< jira ig="6475" >}} (NoSQL); {{< jira ig="6246" >}} (streaming)<br/>
**Owners:** Roy B. (royb) for IG-6475; Or N. (orn) for IG-6246<br/>
Known issue since RN v1.7.0<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) (20.6.18) Michael said that the bug applies to all relevant interfaces &mdash; our web and non-web (Scala, Python, etc.) APIs and Spark DataFrames.
Ori said that the bugs aren't specific to get-items and other NoSQL requests and put/get-records streaming requests, and that we should refer to "I/O requests" in general.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-web-apis" >}}Web APIs{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub id="ki-simple-object-web-api" >}}Simple-Object Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	The <api>GET Service</api> operation for listing containers may sometimes return the container ID in place of the container name.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3027" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3027" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made; (this isn't planned for v1.5 or v1.7).
<br/>
(24.2.18) After speaking with Gilad, it turns out that we now have v1.7.0 Task {{< jira ig="5346" >}} **"eliminate container handle semantics in v3io ..."** for supporting only container names and removing the support for container IDs (handles).
(17.6.18) {{< jira ig="5346" >}} is still planned for v1.7.0 with Status ICEBOX.
I asked Liat and Gilad, in a [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-5346?focusedCommentId=32735&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-32735) in this ticket, whether it shouldn't be re-planned for v1.9.0 and maybe changed to a Requirement or Sub-Requirement.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}
    {{< comment >}}<!-- (sharonl) (29.1.18) In the initial v1.0.0 RNs, this was
      incorrectly documented as a Container Management API List Containers bug.
      When preparing the v1.5.0 RNs, I found that the bug is in our GET Service
      AWS S3-equivalent web-API operation, so I also retroactively edited the
      v1.0.0 RN in the new web documentation. -->
    {{< /comment >}}

- <api>GET Object</api> and <api>HEAD Object</api> operations don't return correct `ETag` and `Content-Type` metadata, and <api>GET Object</api> also doesn't return the correct `Last-Modified` metadata.

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-3451-3453" >}}
**Bugs:** {{< jira ig="3451" >}}; {{< jira ig="3453" >}} (ETag)<br/>
**Owner:** Gilad (giladb)<br/>
Known issue since RN v1.0.0 (`ETag` &mdash; RN phrased differently) and v1.5.0 (the rest, although the bugs probably also exist in earlier releases)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub id="ki-streaming-web-api" >}}Streaming Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	<api>PutRecords</api> with a stream path that points to an existing non-stream directory returns error <api>ResourceNotFoundException</api> instead of <api>ResourceIsnotStream</api>.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4310" owner="Ortal (ortall)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>UpdateStream</api> with an invalid request-body JSON format may not return the expected <api>InvalidArgumentException</api> error.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4310" owner="Ortal (ortall)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <api>DescribeStream</api> returns stream metadata regardless of the user's access permissions.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4021" type="bug" owner="Tal (taln)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" fixver="1.7.0" id="ig-4021" >}}
(sharonl) The v1.5.0 known issue was added for Bug {{< jira ig="5841" >}} "DescribeStream on stream that I don't have permissions to, returning data about the stream".
On 20.2.18, Bug IG-5841 was closed as a duplicate of Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}} "getAttr permission should change".
==> I duplicated the v1.5.0 known issue for Bug IG-5841 bug changed the main JIRA info to Bug IG-4021, and I updated the RNs info in the bugs accordingly.
<br/><br/>
(8.1.18) The bug occurs also with our Scala/Java Streaming API &mdash; <api>V3IOStreamingOperations.describeStream</api>, defined in <path>v3io-streaming/src/main/scala/io/iguaz/v3io/streaming/V3IOStreamingOperations.scala</path> in the `zeta` repo.
However, at Golan's request, this API is not documented or mentioned in the release notes until we align our APIs, so I restricted the v1.5.x known issue to the documented <api>DescribeStream</api> web operation.
(The streaming API alignment is currently planned for v2.0.0.)
<br/>
(18.6.18) The bug was resolved as Fixed in v1.7.0 but the fix wasn't tested by QA.
Adi said to keep the known issue until the fix is verified.
(18.7.18) Still not fixed in v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA).
Ori said not to bother rephrasing the RN issue even if currently applicable to more than `DescribeStream` (I'm not sure).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub id="ki-nosql-web-api" >}}NoSQL Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	Requests with long expressions may fail.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3078" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3078" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (26.6.18) In the previous RNs and in the first version of the v1.7.0 Early Edition RNs that was sent to Equinix, this known issue referred only to filter expressions, but after Gilad informed me that the bug applies also to update expressions I updated the note to refer to "expressions" in general.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>PutItem</api> requests with a very large <paramname>Key</paramname> attribute value may result in response status code 500 instead of 400.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3597" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3597" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (15.7.18) The bug has been resolved and verified in v1.9.0.
&ndash;> In the v1.9.0 RNs we'll move this known issue to the Fixes section.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-spark-apis" >}}Spark APIs{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub id="ki-spark-streaming" >}}Spark Streaming{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

- To consume records from new shards after increasing a stream's shard count, you must first restart the Spark Streaming consumer application.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6471" type="bug" owner="Golan (golans)" docig="7157" ki_start_ver="1.5.3" id="ig-6471" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) The shard-count increase can currently be done only using the <api>UpdateStream</api> Streaming Web API operation.
<br/>
This bug exists also in earlier versions but was discovered only before the v1.5.3 release and the v1.5.0 documentation publication, and therefore added to the RNs only in v1.5.3 + added to the _Software Specifications and Restrictions_ and <api>UpdateStream</api> Streaming Web API reference documentation in v1.5.0 and retroactively also in the v1.0.3 reference &mdash; see DOC Task {{< jira ig="7157" >}}.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}
    {{< comment >}}<!-- [c-spark-streaming-consume-after-shard-increase] -->
    {{< /comment >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-hadoop" >}}Hadoop{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

-	The following Hadoop (`hdfs`) commands are not supported:
    <cmd>createSnapshot</cmd>, <cmd>deleteSnapshot</cmd>, <cmd>getfattr</cmd>, <cmd>setfattr</cmd>, <cmd>setfacl</cmd>, and <cmd>setrep</cmd>.

    {{< internal-release-note ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="hdfs-unsupported-cmds" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (26.6.18) Initially, this known issue included the <cmd>truncate</cmd> command and was associated with Bug {{< jira ig="3106" >}} to implement this command.
Bug 3106 and duplicate Bug {{< jira ig="5239" >}} were resolved in v1.7.0 as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} (not tested by QA), at which point I documented the support for <cmd>truncate</cmd> as an [enhancement](#ig-3106), removed the reference to the command from the known-issue note, and disassociated the known-issue note from Bug 3106.
The changes were done after the initial publication of the v1.7.0 Equinix Early Edition release notes.
<br/>
Golan said there's no JIRA ticket to support the other commands.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-file-system" >}}File System{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

-	File-system operations are not supported for stream shards.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3604" type="task" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3604" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-security" >}}Security{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

-	POSIX security rules are enforced only on a user's primary group.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3093" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3093" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- IdP synchronization might occasionally result in permission issues for imported users.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="8086" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.7.0" owner="oded (odedm)" id="ig-8086" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- For a data-access policy rule with a <gui-label>Users</gui-label> match condition that names both users and user groups &mdash; an "OR" logic is applied separately among all the users and among all the groups, but an "AND" logic is applied between the users and groups.
  Therefore, the user who submits the request must be both one of the named users and belong to one of the named groups.
  To bypass this issue, define separate rules for users and user groups. 

    {{< internal-release-note ig="8415" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.7.1" owner="Oded (odedm)" docig="8595" id="ig-8415" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Data-access policy permissions are checked only for the current directory and not for the entire path.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="8726" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.7.2" owner="Roy B. (royb)" id="ig-8726" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- The "category" criterion of data-access policy rules is ignored for the NoSQL Web API <api>GetItem</api> operation.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="8784" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.7.2" owner="Roy B. (royb)" id="ig-8784" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-platform-mgmt" >}}Platform Management{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Deletion of very large containers, which contain hundreds of millions of objects, might fail.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7954" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.7.0" owner="Gilad (giladb)" id="ig-7954" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-dashboard" >}}Dashboard (UI){{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- The bandwidth and IOPS container performance values are higher than the actual values for Simple-Object Web API <api>Get Object</api> operations.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7776" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.7.0" owner="Assaf T. (assaft)" id="ig-7776" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- The performance graphs in the container overview might display an incorrect spike in the following instances:

    - For the first data point in the graph when initially loading the display (before a periodic refresh occurs).
    - For all data points that are added to the display as a result of the periodic display refresh or when the user changes the display filter.
      Refreshing the display typically resolves the spike for the currently displayed data points.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="8169" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.7.0" owner="Eran N. (erann)" id="ig-8169" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (18.7.18) This issue combines both Bug IG-8129, for the first-data point spike, and for additional related scenarios that Eran N. later discovered and aren't reflected in JIRA.
In the v1.7.0 Early Edition RNs we were only aware of Bug IG-8169 + Eran has now noted that the "temporarily" reference in that RN wasn't accurate because without a manual refresh the spike can remain displayed for a long time.
I therefore rephrased the known issue for the v1.7.1 RNs.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	The container performance statistics don't include multi-record operations, such as <api>GetItems</api> and <api>GetRecords</api>.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4140" type="bug" ki_start_ver="0.12.7" owner="Orit (oritn)" id="ig-4140" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) The bug was resolved for v1.5.0 and then reopened.
(18.6.18) The bug was resolved and closed as "Not a bug" because it was replaced with Requirement {{< jira ig="6348" >}} (currently planned for v1.7.0 bug marked as Cannot Fit).
Adi said to keep this known issue in the RNs until Requirement IG-6348 is handled and verified.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="ki-ui-used-capacity-long-refresh-in-loaded-systems"></a>In heavily loaded systems, the container used-capacity information might take a long time to refresh.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5633" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.7.0" owner="Pavel (pavelr)" id="ig-5633" >}}
<br/>
(21.10.18) In the v1.7 RNs, we initially connected this known issue incorrectly to Bug {{< jira ig="7883" >}} (internally).
We discovered the error when we prepared the v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) RNs, and Ori said that because there's no dedicated bug for this issue, we should connect the issue, for now, to the "KV for file system" Requirement {{< jira ig="5633" >}} &mdash; as implementing and integrating this solution is a prerequisite to resolving the known issue.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-emr" >}}Amazon EMR{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- The EMR cluster can be used only with the default tenant.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7695" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.7.0" owner="Ran (ranl)" id="ig-7695" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (20.6.18) Vadim said that the EMR can be used with the default tenant regardless of whether additional platform tenants are defined.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- The EMR cluster uses a single node, resulting in limited redundancy.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="7701" type="bug" ki_start_ver="1.7.0" id="ig-7701" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (18.7.18) (Based on info from Maor and Ori) Bug IG-7701 was fixed after the v1.7.0 Early Edition RNs for Equinix, which first mentioned it, and before the v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA) release, but it's currently not possible to test it.
(26.7.18) The bug was initially resolved as _Won't Fix_ but the resolution was later changed to _Fixed_.
Adi asked to keep the RN known issue until the fix is verified.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- //////////////////////////////////////// -->
<!-- Notes -->

- Platform start-up, restart, and shut-down should be coordinated with the Iguazio support team.

    {{< internal-release-note docig="5829" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (2.4.18) Adi requested that we add this in the release notes (starting with the v1.5.3 RNs, even though it's also true for earlier versions).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}
