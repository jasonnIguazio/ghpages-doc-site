{{< comment >}}<!-- [c-tsdb-nuclio-funcs-classif] [IntInfo] (sharonl) (27.10.19)
  In the v2.5.0 RNs, I decided to classify TSDB Nuclio functions issues under
  Nuclio instead of under TSDB (in the same way that issues related to the
  Frames "tsdb" backend won't be documented under TSDB). I rephrased the
  "Time-Series Databases (TSDBs)" section headings to
  "V3IO Time-Series Database (TSDB) Library" (and kept the TSDB CLI &
  Prometheus subsections). In locations where a TSDB section is required, I
  also added a note to refer to the respective Nuclio section for TSDB Nuclio
  functions notes where such notes exist. -->

{{< rn-heading h="5" id="new-symlink-web-api" text="Symbolic-Link Web API" >}}

- <a id="new-symlink-web-api"></a>Added web-API support for symbolic links:

  - Added a Symbolic-Link Web API to the data-service web APIs:
    the <api>X-v3io-function</api> request header now supports a <api>CreateSymlink</api> operation for creating a symbolic link to a platform file-system data path (a file or directory a platform data container).
    Such links can then be used from a file-system interface (for example, from a web-shell or Jupyter Notebook service).
  - Added support for retrieving a platform file-system symbolic link by using the <api>GET Object</api> operation of the Simple-Object Web API.
    A new <api>X-v3io-object-type</api> response header indicates the type of the returned object &mdash; <api>regular</api> for a regular data path and <api>symlink</api> for symbolic links.

<br/>
(sharonl) (16.12.20) This note was added retroactively to the v2.5.0 release notes (copied from the v2.8.0 release notes), at the request of Support (Maor) and Product (Adi), after SATA encountered this bug with v2.5.
Following is the internal info for this known issue from the v2.8.0 RNs:
(7.7.20) This note was added retroactively after the publication of the v2.8.0 release notes, following bug reports by customers.
(18.10.20) The bug was fixed in v2.10.0.
As part of the review of the v2.10.0 RNs fix note, Maor requested that we rephrase the fix note and the existing v2.8.0 RNs known issue so as not to refer explicitly to the deletion of other users' services (even though this is what happens in v2.8.0).
=> I retroactively rephrased the v2.8.0 KI to replace "cause the services of all other users to be deleted" with "impact other users' services", and I phrased the v2.10.0 RNs fix note in a similar manner.

<br/>
(sharonl) Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made.
<br/>
(24.2.18) After speaking with Gilad, it turns out that we now have v1.7.0 Task {{< jira ig="5346" >}} **"eliminate container handle semantics in v3io ..."** for supporting only container names and removing the support for container IDs (handles).
<br/>
(25.5.20) {{< jira ig="5346" >}} was done in v2.2.0.
I confirmed with Assaf B. that **the bug doesn't exist since v2.2.0**.
However, as I missed this in the v2.2.0&ndash;2.5.0 release notes (because the KI was connected to Bug IG-3027 and not to Task IG-5346), it still appears (incorrectly) as a known issue in these release notes.
In the v2.8.0 release notes I removed this KI.
I didn't replace it with a fix note because the fix was done in v2.2.0.

- <a id="ki-frames-null-attr-vals-read-ret-def-values"></a>Null item-attribute values are replaced in the pandas DataFrame that's returned by the <cmd>read</cmd> method with the default value for the attribute type (for example, `0` for an integer attribute or `false` for a Boolean attribute).
  Note: Take care not to write the incorrect read values back to the table.

<br/>
(sharonl) (20.10.19) The underlying bug isn't backend specific, but it was decided, in consultation with R&D and Adi, that this can be classified as a `kv` backend bug because it's not likely to have null values for the `tsdb` and `stream` backends.

- <a id="ki-frames-kv-infer-schema-wo-key-param"></a>When inferring the table schema without setting the <paramname>key</paramname> parameter of the client <func>execute</func> <cmd>infer</cmd> command, the schema key isn't set to the name of the table's primary-key attribute.
  Consequently, the table can't be read with Spark DataFrames or Presto, and reading the table with Frames returns an extra <attr>\_\_name</attr> attribute (column), in addition to the primary-key attribute that contains the same values.

**RNs Review Note:** The v2.5.0 RNs review is for the removal of the reference to the <cmd>truncate</cmd> command. See details below.
<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) (26.6.18) Initially, this known issue included the <cmd>truncate</cmd> command and was associated with Bug {{< jira ig="3106" >}} to implement this command.
Bug 3106 and duplicate Bug {{< jira ig="5239" >}} were resolved in v1.7.0 as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} (not tested by QA), at which point I documented the support for <cmd>truncate</cmd> as an {{< xref s="release-notes" f="version-1.7/v1.7.1.md" a="ig-3106" text="enhancement" >}} in the v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA) release notes, removed the reference to the command from the known-issue note, and disassociated the known-issue note from Bug 3106.
The changes were done after the initial publication of the v1.7.0 Equinix Early Edition release notes.
<br/>
Golan said there's no Jira ticket to support the other commands.
<br/>
(2.5.19) In the v2.1.0 release notes, the reference to the supported <cmd>truncate</cmd> command was marked as  {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}}.
(27.10.19) In the v2.5.0 RNs, the <cmd>truncate</cmd> reference was removed from this note, after QA have verified the support for this command.

<br/>
(sharonl) (10.7.19) In the **v2.1.0 &amp; v2.2.0** release notes we had a known issue for this HA bug that wasn't restricted to cloud environments.
The known issue was for Bug {{< jira ig="11774" >}}.
In **v2.3.0**, this bug was fixed only for non-cloud environments and Bug {{< jira ig="12573" >}} and Requirement {{< jira ig="12636" >}} were opened for the remaining cloud issues.
=> In the v2.3.0 release notes, I restricted the known issue to cloud environments and linked it to the new cloud tickets, and I added a {{< xref s="release-notes" f="version-2.3/v2.3.0.md" a="fix-ha-main-k8s-master-app-node-failure-non-cloud" text="fix note" >}} for non-cloud environments.
(24.5.20) In **v2.8.0**, the KI was fixed for AWS as part of Requirement {{< jira ig="12636" >}}, which was then modified not to cover Azure and a separate v3.0.0 Requirement {{< jira ig="13840" >}} was opened for Azure cloud deployment changes that should also fix this KI, and the RN KI was modified accordingly and tagged `#ki-ha-main-k8s-master-app-node-failure-cloud-azure`; see also the v2.8.0 RNs `#fix-cloud-vip-aws` fix note.

<br/>
(sharonl) This issue is also documented in the **"Software Specifications and Restrictions"** doc (`#duplicated-sys-failure-recovery-data`).
<br/>
(27.2.19) Bug {{< jira ig="7790" >}} has now been closed as _Won't Fix_.
Ori wrote in the comments "This is a know arch limitation of the system, at this point one can use the conditional update with the mtime returned on the command".
(2.6.19) Orit confirmed that the issue persists in v2.2.0 and she and Adi said to keep the known issue in the release notes as-is (see also this IG-7790 [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-7790?focusedCommentId=44092&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-44092) in Bug {{< jira ig="7790" >}}).
Orit wrote that this issue isn't related to the app nodes but rather the data path.
<br/>
(17.10.19) I decided to stop making RN-updates in Bug {{< jira ig="7790" >}} because the bug has been closed as _Won't Fix_ for a while and the issue isn't likely to be resolved in the foreseeable future.
Bug {{< jira ig="4887" >}}, which is also related to this known issue, is still open, so I still update the RN information in that bug.

<br/>
(sharonl) (26.2.19) In previous release notes we had a combined HA known issue for bugs {{< jira ig="6475" >}} and {{< jira ig="6246" >}}, phrased generically as "I/O requests might fail during failover.", per Ori's guideline (see, for example, the {{< xref s="release-notes" f="version-1.9/v1.9.5.md" a="ki-ha-io-requests-failure-ig-6475-6246" text="v1.9.5 RNs" >}}) and the details in the bugs' _Release Note Information_).
In v2.0.0, Bug IG-6246 was fixed and closed, but Bug IG-6475 is still open and was deferred to v2.4.0.
Roy B. and Ortal confirmed that the remaining known issue for Bug IG-6475 is only for the <api>GetItems</api> NoSQL Web API operation.
Therefore, I rephrased the known issue and created a {{< xref s="release-notes" f="version-2.0/v2.0.0.md" text="v2.0.0 release notes" a="fix-ha-io-stream-requests-failure-ig-6246" text="fix RN" >}} for Bug IG-6246.

<br/>
(sharonl) (30.8.18) In the v1.7.2 RNs, we connected the similar known issue to Bug {{< jira ig="8726" >}}, which has since then been resolved as a duplicate of Bug {{< jira ig="8733" >}}.
Therefore, I connected the v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) known issue to the open bug (IG-8733).
(24.4.19) IG-8733 is still open but doesn't have a target version.
(Previously, it was planned for v2.0.0, which has since then been released).
<br/>
(26.7.19) The ticket type is "Requirement" and not "Bug", as indicated in the internal info for previous release notes.
Perhaps it was originally a bug and was then converted to a requirement.
<br/>
(14.5.20) Per Orit's request, in the v2.8.0 release notes I removed this known issue (without replacing it with a fix note).
Orit wrote the following in [Bug IG-8733](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-8733?focusedCommentId=41377&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-41377) on 7.1.20, and then [confirmed](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-8733?focusedCommentId=63045&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-63045) on 13.5.20 that we should remove the known issue:

(20.3.19) At Maor's request, I rephrased the previous note to replace "restart, and shut-down" with "start-up and upgrade" (+ I added "actions"); Maor said that customers don't need to coordinate platform shutdowns.
