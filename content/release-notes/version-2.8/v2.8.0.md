{{< /note >}}

- <a id="new-service-version-upgrades"></a><a id="k8s-version-upgrade"></a>Upgraded to Kubernetes version 1.15.5 and Grafana version 6.6.0.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-service-version-upgrades" ig="13859" type="subreq" req="7750" owner="Oded M. (odedm)" docig="15185" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (17.9.20) I added the Grafana info retroactively and updated the v2.8.0 supported Grafana version after during the v2.10.0 support-matrix checks we found that the v2.8.0 Grafana version upgrade.
(The internal support matrix has now been updated accordingly as well.)
See details in the **"2.10 closure - Support matrix - Take 2"** email thread and in the v2.10.0 specs- update doc task &mdash; DOC {{< jira ig="16762" >}}.

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading h="4" id="new-jupyter" text="Jupyter Notebook" >}}

- <a id="new-jupyter-versions-upgrade"></a>Upgraded versions of preinstalled and certified software &mdash;

    - JupyterLab &mdash; version 1.0.10
    - Jupyter Notebook &mdash; version 6.0.3
    - Conda &mdash; version 4.7.11
    - Nuclio Jupyter package (**nuclio-jupyter**) &mdash; version v0.8.1
    - Platform tutorial Jupyter notebooks &mdash; version v2.8.11
    - NVIDIA CUDA version 10.1

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-jupyter-versions-upgrade" ig="15326" type="req" owner="Uri H. (urih)" docig="15185" id="support-matrix-jupyter" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-jupyter-scale-to-zero"></a>Added scale-to-zero support:
    when the <gui-label>Scale to zero</gui-label> option is enabled for a Jupyter Notebook service (from the common service parameters on the dashboard <gui-label>Services</gui-label> page), the platform automatically frees up Jupyter Notebook resources when the service becomes idle.
    This feature is recommended mainly when working with GPUs.

    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-jupyter-variable-inspector"></a>Added a variable-inspector extension ([jupyterlab_variableinspector](https://github.com/lckr/jupyterlab-variableInspector)) to the UI of the Jupyter Notebook service.
    The right-click context menu of the notebook cells now has an <gui-label>Open Variable inspector</gui-label> option that opens a <gui-title>Variable Inspector</gui-title> window with detailed information about the variables used in executed cell code (including the variables' types, sizes, and values).

    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-jupyter-envir-per-service-instance"></a>Moved to using separate Jupyter `pip` environments for each instance of the Jupyter Notebook service.
    In previous releases, the `pip` environment was shared among all Jupyter Notebook instances for the same running user.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-jupyter-envir-per-service-instance" ig="13678" type="req" owner="Uri H. (urih)" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-jupyter-pvc"></a>Added support for connecting existing cluster Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to a Jupyter Notebook service.
    You can select the PVCs from the dashboard's <gui-title>Services</gui-title> page &mdash; see the new <gui-label>Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)</gui-label> custom-parameters section of the Jupyter Notebook service.

<br/>
See also the related [web-shell enhancement](#new-web-shell-service-admin-pvc-support) for adding PVC CRUD support to the web-shell's Service Admin account.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-jupyter-rapids-not-predeployed"></a>Removed NVIDIA RAPIDS from the default Jupyter Notebook environment.
    You can easily install RAPIDS manually from Jupyter Notebook using Conda.
    For example:
    ```python
    conda create -n rapids -c rapidsai -c nvidia -c anaconda -c conda-forge -c defaults rapids=0.12 python=3.7 cudatoolkit=10.1
    ```

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading h="4" id="new-frames" text="V3IO Frames" >}}

- <a id="new-frames-official-support-n-version-upgrade"></a>Added official support for the V3IO Frames service (previously supported as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}}), and upgraded to Frames version v0.6.18-v0.9.24.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-frames-official-support-n-version-upgrade" id="support-matrix-frames" >}}
**Sub-Requirement** for Requirement 7750: {{< jira ig="11291" >}} (production support for Frames)<br/>
**Owner:** Dina N. (dinan)<br/>
**DOC Issues:** {{< jira ig="12007" >}} (production support for Frames); {{< jira ig="15185" >}} (RAPIDS)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-frames-performance-imprv"></a>Improved the performance of the NoSQL and TSDB backends.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-frames-performance-imprv" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (1.6.20) This is based on information from Orit.
There's no dedicated Jira ticket for this.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-frames-api-changes"></a>Modified the Frames client API to improve the user experience.
    Note that the changes break backwards compatibility with the previous {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} API:

    - <api>Client</api> constructor &mdash; moved the mandatory <paramname>container</paramname> parameter before the optional <paramname>data_url</paramname> parameter.
    - <func>create</func> method &mdash;
        - Replaced the <paramname>attrs</paramname> dictionary parameter with a <paramname>**kw</paramname> parameter to support passing backend-specific keyword arguments as regular function parameters.
      - Renamed the <paramname>aggregation-granularity</paramname> argument (previously an <paramname>attrs</paramname> key) to <paramname>aggregation_granularity</paramname> (TSDB backend).
    - <func>write</func> and <func>read</func> methods &mdash; renamed the <paramname>max_in_message</paramname> parameter to <paramname>max_rows_in_msg</paramname>.
    - <func>execute</func> method &mdash; renamed the <cmd>inferschema</cmd> command to <cmd>infer_schema</cmd> (NoSQL backend).

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-frames-api-changes" ig="14367" type="req" owner="Dina N. (dinan)" docig="14369" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) We didn't mention changes for API elements that were intentionally not documented in v2.5 (and are currently also not planned to be documented for v2.8.0 &mdash;

- <func>read</func> method &mdash; renamed the <paramname>aggregationWindow</paramname> keyword argument to <paramname>aggregation_window</paramname> (TSDB backend).
- <func>execute</func> &mdash; renamed the <paramname>clientinfo</paramname> argument (<paramname>args</paramname> dictionary key) to <paramname>client_info</paramname> (streaming backend).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
{{< rn-heading h="5" id="new-frames-nosql" text="Frames NoSQL Backend (&quot;nosql&quot;/&quot;kv&quot;)" >}}

- <a id="new-frames-nosql-new-nosql-backend-type-alias"></a>Added a <api>nosql</api> backend type &mdash; an alias to the existing <api>kv</api> type.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-frames-nosql-new-nosql-backend-type-alias" ig="14367" type="req" owner="Dina N. (dinana)" docig="14369" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-frames-nosql-delete-by-filter"></a>Added support for deleting specific items according to a filter expression, which can be applied to item attributes.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-frames-nosql-delete-by-filter" ig="13892" type="req" owner="Tal N. (taln)" docig="13893" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-frames-nosql-write-save-modes"></a>Added a new <paramname>save_mode</paramname> parameter to the <func>write</func> method to support different types of write modes &mdash; <api>"errorIfTableExists"</api>, <api>"overwriteTable"</api>, <api>"overwriteItem"</api>, <api>"createNewItemsOnly"</api>.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-frames-nosql-write-save-modes" ig="13663" type="req" owner="Tal N. (taln)" docig="13747" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-frames-nosql-read-partitioned-tables"></a>Added support for reading partitioned tables.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-frames-nosql-read-partitioned-tables" ig="12459" type="req" owner="Tal N. (taln)" docig="12795" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-frames-nosql-read-sys-attr"></a>Added support for reading the following system attributes: `__gid`, `__mode`, `__mtime_nsecs`, `__mtime_secs`, `__size`, `__uid`, `__ctime_nsecs`, `__ctime_secs`, `__atime_secs"`, `__atime_nsecs`, `__obj_type`, `__collection_id`.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-frames-nosql-read-sys-attr" ig="14140" type="req" owner="Dina N. (dinan)" docig="14715" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-frames-nosql-range-scan-tp"></a>{{< techpreview mark="1" >}} Added support for range scans by using the <func>read</func> method's <paramname>sort_key_range_start</paramname> and <paramname>sort_key_range_end</paramname> keyword arguments.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-frames-nosql-range-scan-tp" ig="13590" type="req" owner="Dina N. (dinan)" docig="13749" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (31.5.20) The Frames NoSQL backend's {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} range-scan support also includes the <func>read</func> method's <paramname>sharding_keys</paramname> argument, which was already documented for v2.5 (without a specific {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} indication, because Frames as a whole was {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} in v2.5).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
{{< rn-heading h="5" id="new-frames-tsdb" text="Frames TSDB Backend (&quot;tsdb&quot;)" >}}

- <a id="new-frames-tsdb-delete-imprv"></a>Added support for deleting specific TSDB table items using different types of filters:

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading h="4" id="new-mlrun" text="MLRun" techpreview="1" >}}

- <a id="new-mlrun-enhancements-tp"></a>Extended and enhanced the {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} support for [MLRun](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun) &mdash; {{< company >}}'s open-source library for automating and tracking data science tasks and full workflows, which integrates seamlessly with Kubeflow Pipelines and the Nuclio serverless framework and affords the following capabilities:

    -	Experiments tracking
    - Artifacts and functions management (code and data versioning)
    -	A functions marketplace 
    -	Model monitoring

    Among the MLRun enhancements in v2.8.0 of the platform &mdash;

    - <a id="new-mlrun-default-service-cloud-predeploy-tp"></a>Added a shared single-instance tenant-wide MLRun service (`mlrun`).
        In the current release, the service is pre-deployed as a default service in cloud deployments.
        To add the service for other types of deployments, contact {{< company >}}'s {{< email id="support" link="1" text="support team" >}}.
        {{< comment >}}<!-- [c-mlrun-predeployed-service] -->
        {{< /comment >}}

    - <a id="new-mlrun-version-upgrade-tp"></a>Upgraded to MLRun version 0.4.7.
        For future upgrades to newer MLRun releases, consult {{< company >}}'s {{< email id="support" link="1" text="support team" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-mlrun-enhancements-tp" ig="14393" type="req" owner="Hedi I. (hedii)" docig="15704" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (26.5.20) MLRun was already documented in v2.5.4 (albeit very succinctly), but it wasn't mentioned in the v2.5.0 release notes.
Product (Gilad and Adi) and R&D (Oded) wanted to emphasize MLRun and its capabilities in the v2.8.0 release notes and link to the MLRun repo (which contains the MLRun documentation), even thought it's still {{< techpreview mark="1" fmt="0" >}}.
For this reason we also placed the MLRun and pipelines sections relatively high in the RNs sequence.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading h="4" id="new-pipelines" text="Pipelines" >}}

- <a id="new-pipelines-version-upgrade"></a>Upgraded to Kubeflow Pipelines version 0.2.5.

{{< rn-heading h="4" id="new-nuclio" text="Nuclio Serverless Functions" >}}

- <a id="new-nuclio-version-upgrade"></a>Upgraded to Nuclio version 1.3.25, featuring multiple enhancements, including the following:

    - Iguazio MLOps Platform stream trigger (`v3ioStream`) &mdash; added support for using consumer groups.
    - Kafka trigger (`kafka-cluster`) &mdash; added support for using the [Sarama](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Shopify/sarama?tab=doc) Go client library (`sarama`) to read from Kafka.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="new-nuclio-version-upgrade" owner="Oded M. (odedm)" docig="15185" >}}

(sharonl) (26.5.20) Orit requested that we mention the feature enhancements listed in this note.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-nuclio-api-gateways"></a>Added support for creating API gateways for load balancing of Nuclio functions, which allows function A/B testing and canary deployment (rollout).
    You can create an API gateway from the new <gui-title>API Gateways</gui-title> dashboard tab for your project &mdash; see the [dashboard project enhancements](#new-ui-project-api-gateways).

<br/>
(sharonl) (20.5.20) In the v2.5.0 release notes we had the following related {{< xref s="release-notes" f="version-2.5/v2.5.0.md" a="ki-frames-null-attr-vals-read-ret-def-values" text="v2.5.0 known issue" >}}, which we decided to classify as a NoSQL (`kv`) backend bug, even though the underlying bug isn't backend specific, because it it's not likely to have null values for the `tsdb` and `stream` backends.
But as the fix wasn't backend specific, I decided not to classify it as such.

> Null item-attribute values are replaced in the pandas DataFrame that's returned by the <cmd>read</cmd> method with the default value for the attribute type (for example, `0` for an integer attribute or `false` for a Boolean attribute).

(sharonl) (20.10.19) For table directories with a NoSQL table schema file, the dashboard attempts to load the table view by default.

- <a id="ki-service-admin-policy-via-group-only"></a>Users who are members of a user group with the Service Admin management policy, but aren't assigned this policy directly, don't have proper service-administration permissions:
    such users can see only their services on the <gui-label>Services</gui-label> dashboard page, and any changes that they make to their services impact other users' services.
  To bypass this issue, either assign the Service Admin management policy directly to the users; remove the users from groups with this policy; or remove the policy from the relevant user groups.

    {{< internal-release-note rnid="ki-service-admin-policy-via-group-only" ig="16267" type="bug" ki_start_ver="2.8.0" owner="Oded M. (odedm)" docig="15178" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (7.7.20) This note was added retroactively after the publication of the v2.8.0 release notes, following bug reports by customers.
(18.10.20) The bug was fixed in v2.10.0.
As part of the review of the v2.10.0 RNs fix note, Maor requested that we rephrase the fix note and the existing v2.8.0 RNs known issue so as not to refer explicitly to the deletion of other users' services (even though this is what happens in v2.8.0).
=> I retroactively rephrased the v2.8.0 KI to replace "cause the services of all other users to be deleted" with "impact other users' services", and I phrased the v2.10.0 RNs fix note in a similar manner.

<br/>
(sharonl) (21.3.19) In consultation with Adi, I documented this only as a known issue in the release notes, but not in other doc locations.
<br/>
(25.5.20) In the v2.0.0&ndash;v2.5.0 RNs, this issue was associated with Bug {{< jira ig="11202" >}}.
On 6.5.20, Orit closed this bug as _Not a bug_ and opened Requirement {{< jira ig="14150" >}} "deletion of user workspace when deleting a user" (currently planned for v3.0.0), which according to Orit should also resolve this issue.
=> I've now linked the KI in Jira to requirement IG-14150 instead of the closed IG-11202 bug (including duplicating the existing RN labels and adding a KI RN label for v2.8.0), and I've marked IG-11202 as _External Release Note_ = _DONE_ so that it doesn't appear in related queries.
{{< comment >}}<!-- [IntInfo] (sharonl) (25.5.20) In the v2.8.0 RNs I also

(sharonl) (24.5.20) Assaf B. wanted to restrict this to execution from different instances of the Jupyter NB service, as this is the bug that was reported and tested and Assaf suspects the issue won't occur when running multiple NBs from the same Jupyter NB service. But Orit preferred a more generic phrasing, just to be safe.

- <a id="ki-jupyter-dir-rename"></a>Renaming a directory (folder) with <func>shutil.move</func> &mdash; which is also used when renaming a directory from the JupyterLab UI &mdash; is handled by recursively copying all the contents of the current directory and then deleting the old directory.
    This currently has the following implications:

    - NoSQL-table and stream directories, including nested directories in the renamed path, aren't copied correctly, resulting in a corrupted collection and data loss.
    - For large directories, the renaming operation might take a long time to complete.
    - If a notebook or other file within the renamed directory remains open during the renaming, you need to re-select the "Python 3" kernel from the JupyterLab UI before running Python code from this file.

In v2.8.0, if you try to add a coordinator or worker Presto configuration file with the same name as an existing file of the other type (worker/coordinator), you get an error (`"ERROR Duplicate presto resource - <resource file>"`).

**RNs Review Note:** The v2.5.0 RNs review is for the removal of the reference to the <cmd>truncate</cmd> command. See details below.
<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) (26.6.18) Initially, this known issue included the <cmd>truncate</cmd> command and was associated with Bug {{< jira ig="3106" >}} to implement this command.
Bug 3106 and duplicate Bug {{< jira ig="5239" >}} were resolved in v1.7.0 as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} (not tested by QA), at which point I documented the support for <cmd>truncate</cmd> as an {{< xref s="release-notes" f="version-1.7/v1.7.1.md" a="ig-3106" text="enhancement" >}} in the v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA) release notes, removed the reference to the command from the known-issue note, and disassociated the known-issue note from Bug 3106.
The changes were done after the initial publication of the v1.7.0 Equinix Early Edition release notes.
<br/>
Golan said there's no Jira ticket to support the other commands.
<br/>
(2.5.19) In the v2.1.0 release notes, the reference to the supported <cmd>truncate</cmd> command was marked as  {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}}.
(27.10.19) In the v2.5.0 RNs, the <cmd>truncate</cmd> reference was removed from this note, after QA have verified the support for this command.

In **v2.3.0**, this bug was fixed only for non-cloud environments and Bug {{< jira ig="12573" >}} and Requirement {{< jira ig="12636" >}} were opened for the remaining cloud issues.

In v2.0.0, Bug IG-6246 was fixed and closed, but Bug IG-6475 is still open and was deferred to v2.4.0.
Roy B. and Ortal confirmed that the remaining known issue for Bug IG-6475 is only for the <api>GetItems</api> NoSQL Web API operation.

(25.5.20)At Maor's request, I returned the reference to "shut-down". Maor wrote (in his v2.8.0 RNs review) &mdash; "I know I (probably) said a user can shutdown the platform by himself (cause he can, thru the UI), but let's add "shutdown" there as well.
The reason is that customer can't really verify a successful shutdown, and might end up with a full data loss if they physically shutdown the servers without verifying the data from the cache was dumped into the disks."
