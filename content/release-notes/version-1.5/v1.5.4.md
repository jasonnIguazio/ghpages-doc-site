<!-- Fixes -->
{{< rn-heading t="fixes" >}}

- <a id="v1.5.4-stability-fix"></a>In rare cases, when the system is running under a heavy load, a race condition might be triggered, causing loss of access to the platform.

    {{< internal-release-note fixver="1.5.4" >}}
(sharonl) (27.5.18) This note was phrased in consultation with Adi and Maor, taking into account that both PickMe and Equinix encountered the bug in v1.5.3.
The v1.5.4 fix is only a partial patch to allow the system to recover from the failure.
Maor said the fix is related to Bug {{< jira ig="7754" >}}, which is still open and planned for v1.7.0 (with v1.5.3 marked as an affected version).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- //////////////////////////////////////// -->
<!-- Known Issues -->
{{< rn-heading t="known-issues" >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-general" >}}General{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Automated system-failure recovery for ingested stream records or for data appended to a simple object might result in data duplication.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4887" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-backup-n-recovery" >}}Backup and Recovery{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Stream data is not backed up and restored as part of the platform's backup and upgrade operations.

    {{< internal-release-note ki_start_ver="1.5.1" >}}
(13.2.18) Adi requested that we document this as a known issue in the RNs even though this behavior is by design and currently there's no plan to change it.
This will also be documented in the software specifications and restrictions document (DOC Task {{< jira ig="3582" >}}).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-expressions" >}}Condition and Update Expressions{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- When the <func>min</func>, <func>max</func>, <func>starts</func>, <func>ends</func>, or <func>contains</func> expression function receives too many arguments, the operation is skipped and the function doesn't return an error.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6086" type="bug" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.5.3" fixver="1.7.0" id="ig-6086" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (27.3.18) The description in Bug IG-6086 refers to a crash and the fix version is only 1.7.0.
However, Gal S. told me that in **v1.5.0&ndash;1.5.2**, passing too many arguments to the <func>min</func>, <func>max</func>, <func>starts</func>, <func>ends</func>, or <func>contains</func> expression functions caused a VN crash, and that this was fixed in **v1.5.3** (even though the fix version for Bug IG-6086 is only v1.7.0).
Gal said that in **v1.5.3** there's no crash but we still don't validate the number of arguments and when passing too many arguments the operation is skipped and no error is returned; this was fixed in **v1.7.0**.
Sagi told me he only tested the behavior in v1.7.0, and he verified that in this version the function returns a 400 error.
(He didn't test too few arguments but has now made a note to add such tests.)
In consultation with Adi, I didn't add a Fixes note for the undocumented VN crash bug that was fixed in v1.5.3.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="ki-presto" >}}Presto {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- The <cmd>SHOW TABLES</cmd> command may hang for large tables.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6497" type="bug" owner="Dina (dinan)" ki_start_ver="1.5.1" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) Adi said to document only the Presto issue, as originally reported in the bug, and not mention the underlying nginx issue raised in the bug.
<br/>
(22.2.18) Adi decided to keep this known issue even though Meir says that <cmd>SHOW TABLES</cmd> (and <cmd>SHOW SCHEMAS</cmd>) aren't currently supported and shouldn't be used by customers.
(Nir confirmed that <cmd>SHOW TABLES</cmd> works, subject to the known large-tables issue.)

{{< rn-heading-small-sub id="ki-simple-object-web-api" >}}Simple-Object Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	The <api>GET Service</api> operation for listing containers may sometimes return the container ID in place of the container name.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3027" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3027" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made; (this isn't planned for v1.5 or v1.7).
<br/>
(24.2.18) After speaking with Gilad, it turns out that we now have v1.7.0 Task {{< jira ig="5346" >}} **"eliminate container handle semantics in v3io ..."** for supporting only container names and removing the support for container IDs (handles).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}
    {{< comment >}}<!-- (sharonl) (29.1.18) In the initial v1.0.0 RNs, this was
      incorrectly documented as a Container Management API List Containers bug.
      When preparing the v1.5.0 RNs, I found that the bug is in our GET Service
      AWS S3-equivalent web-API operation, so I also retroactively edited the
      v1.0.0 RN in the new web documentation. -->
    {{< /comment >}}

- <api>GET Object</api> and <api>HEAD Object</api> operations don't return correct `ETag` and `Content-Type` metadata, and <api>GET Object</api> also doesn't return the correct `Last-Modified` metadata.

    {{< internal-release-note >}}
**Bugs:** {{< jira ig="3451" >}}; {{< jira ig="3453" >}} (ETag)<br/>
**Owner:** Gilad (giladb)<br/>
Known issue since RN v1.0.0 (`ETag` &mdash; RN phrased differently) and v1.5.0 (the rest, although the bugs probably also exist in earlier releases)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub id="ki-streaming-web-api" >}}Streaming Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	<api>PutRecords</api> with a stream path that points to an existing non-stream directory returns error <api>ResourceNotFoundException</api> instead of <api>ResourceIsnotStream</api>.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4310" owner="Ortal (ortall)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>UpdateStream</api> with an invalid request-body JSON format may not return the expected <api>InvalidArgumentException</api> error.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4310" owner="Ortal (ortall)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <api>DescribeStream</api> returns stream metadata regardless of the user's access permissions.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4021" type="bug" owner="Tal (taln)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
(sharonl) The v1.5.0 known issue was added for Bug {{< jira ig="5841" >}} "DescribeStream on stream that I don't have permissions to, returning data about the stream".
On 20.2.18, Bug IG-5841 was closed as a duplicate of Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}} "getAttr permission should change".
==> I duplicated the v1.5.0 known issue for Bug IG-5841 bug changed the main JIRA info to Bug IG-4021, and I updated the RNs info in the bugs accordingly.
<br/><br/>
(8.1.18) The bug occurs also with our Scala/Java Streaming API &mdash; <api>V3IOStreamingOperations.describeStream</api>, defined in <path>v3io-streaming/src/main/scala/io/iguaz/v3io/streaming/V3IOStreamingOperations.scala</path> in the `zeta` repo.
However, at Golan's request, this API is not documented or mentioned in the release notes until we align our APIs, which is planned for v1.7.0, so I restricted the v1.5.x known issue to the documented <api>DescribeStream</api> web operation.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub id="ki-nosql-web-api" >}}NoSQL Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	Requests with long filter expressions may fail.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3078" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3078" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>PutItem</api> requests with an item that contains unnamed attributes succeed.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="2423" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>PutItem</api> requests with a very large <paramname>Key</paramname> attribute value may result in response status code 500 instead of 400.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3597" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	Object (item) size restrictions  &mdash;

    - Each attribute must be smaller than 64 KB.

    - The total size of all attributes whose size is smaller or equal to 200 bytes cannot exceed 8 KB.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="2498" type="bug" owner="Alex (alext)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- When setting an item's primary key using <paramname>Key</paramname> request parameter of the <api>PutItem</api> or <api>UpdateItem</api> operation, you cannot define a user attribute with the same name (even if the value is the same).
    Note that when using the <paramname>Key</paramname> parameter, the platform automatically creates a matching user attribute for you.
    If you wish to create the attribute yourself, pass the item's name (primary key) in the request URL instead of using the JSON <paramname>Key</paramname> parameter.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="2068" type="bug" docig="5730" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
(sharonl) Orit wanted to document this as a known issue, even though we also explain this in the API reference.
This issue also exists in earlier releases but was not mentioned in previous release notes.

- To perform more than one action on the stream data, you must first cache the RDD.
    Note that this is the recommended practice in Spark Streaming.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5711" type="bug" docig="5973" owner="Igor (igorm)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" fixver="1.7.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- To consume records from new shards after increasing a stream's shard count, you must first restart the Spark Streaming consumer application.

  {{< internal-release-note ig="6471" type="bug" docig="7157" owner="Golan (golans)" ki_start_ver="1.5.3" id="ig-6471" >}}
<!-- [c-spark-streaming-consume-after-shard-increase] -->
(sharonl) The shard-count increase can currently be done only using the <api>UpdateStream</api> Streaming Web API operation.
<br/>
This bug exists also in earlier versions but was discovered only before the v1.5.3 release and the v1.5.0 documentation publication, and therefore added to the RNs only in v1.5.3 + added to the _Software Specifications and Restrictions_ and <api>UpdateStream</api> Streaming Web API reference documentation in v1.5.0 and retroactively also in the v1.0.3 reference &mdash; see DOC Task {{< jira ig="7157" >}}.

(24.12.17) Golan indicated in a [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-3106?focusedCommentId=24374&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-24374) in Bug 3106 that this bug will not be fixed in v1.5.0.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4140" type="bug" ki_start_ver="0.12.7" owner="Orit (oritn)" id="ig-4140" >}}
(sharonl) The bug was resolved for v1.5.0 and then reopened.
There's an open discussion in the bug comments whether this is actually a bug and what should be the correct behavior.
(23.1.18) Orit said to keep the RNs known issue as-is.

<!-- Notes -->
{{< rn-heading t="notes" >}}


- Platform start-up, restart, and shut-down should be coordinated with the Iguazio support team.

    {{< internal-release-note docig="5829" >}}
(sharonl) (2.4.18) Adi requested that we add this in the release notes (starting with the v1.5.3 RNs, even though it's also true for earlier versions).
