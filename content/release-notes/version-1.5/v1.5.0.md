<!-- New Features and Enhancements -->
{{< rn-heading t="new-and-enhance" >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}General{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Added support for multi-node clusters that contain up to three nodes.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4240" type="req" owner="Meir (meirl)" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added support for using the platform with the [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) framework.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3970" type="req" owner="Ilan Gayda (ilang)" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Added the following open-source third-party applications to the default platform installation:
    - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) machine-intelligence (MI) library
    - [Sparkling Water](https://www.h2o.ai/sparkling-water/) library for integrating the H2O.ai machine-learning platform with Apache Spark, including support for [pysparkling](https://github.com/svenkreiss/pysparkling) to simplify development of Python applications over Spark
    - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python data science distribution

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4210" type="req" owner="Assaf L. (assafl)" id="ig-4210" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}High Availability (HA){{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Implemented a no single point of failure (SPOF) design.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4214" type="req" owner="Oded (odedm)" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small id="new-n-enhance-update-expressions" >}}Update Expressions{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- <a id="update-expressions"></a>
    Added support for update expressions that simplify and extend the ability to update item attributes, including changing attribute values and deleting attributes.
    The support includes a new assignment operator (`=`) and <func>if_not_exists</func>, <func>min</func>, and <func>max</func> expression functions.

    {{< internal-release-note type="req" id="ig-4229" >}}
**Requirements:** {{< jira ig="4229" >}} (v1.5.0); {{< jira ig="2953" >}} (v1.0.0, a.k.a. v0.13.0, Tech Preview)<br/>
**R&D Bugs and Tasks:** {{< jira ig="2948" >}} (v0.13.0); {{< jira ig="4845" >}} (<api>SET</api> and <api>REMOVE</api> support); {{< jira ig="4855" >}} (change the <func>if_not_exists</func> prototype and behavior compared to the undocumented v1.0 Tech Preview version)<br/>
**Owner:** Gal S. (gals)<br/>
**DOC Tasks:** {{< jira ig="3333" >}} (general update-expressions support and <func>if_not_exists</func>); {{< jira ig="3335" >}} (<func>min</func> and <func>max</func>); {{< jira ig="5471" >}} (<api>SET</api> and <api>REMOVE</api>)<br/>
See separate release notes for related [web](#update-expressions-nosql-web-api-changes) and [Scala](#update-expressions-nosql-scala-api-changes) API changes.<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) (31.12.17) In consultation with Adi, I didn't mention the <func>delete</func> function because per Orit's guidelines we don't document this function and only document the alternative <api>REMOVE</api> keyword (although it's still technically possible to use the function instead).
<br/>
(28.1.18) I restricted the <func>min</func>, <func>max</func>, and <func>if_not_exists</func> functions to update expressions after speaking with Gal S. and Meir:
we didn't fully test the use of the functions in condition/filter expressions, and we are already aware of some bugs for such uses (including Bug {{< jira ig="6297" >}} and issues with the Tech Preview arrays feature).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Web APIs{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Added support for sending secure HTTPS requests with user authentication.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4237" type="req" docig="5974" owner="Simon (simong)" id="ig-4237" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (1.1.18) I verified with Ori, Gilad, and Simon that in v1.5.0 we support sending HTTPS web-API requests with a username and password.
(If no credentials are passed and a default web-gateway user is configured, the requests will still succeed.)<br/>
    (Bug {{< jira ig="5571" >}} &mdash; empty password passes authentication when a default web-gateway (nginx) user is configured &mdash; was intentionally not mentioned in the RNs and ultimately it seems that it was fixed in time for the v1.5.0 release.)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}Streaming Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

- Added to the <api>Seek</api> operation a `Type=TIME` option for retrieving a location within a shard based on the records' ingestion (arrival) time.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3606" type="bug" docig="3400" owner="Ortal (ortall)" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) This issue is classified as a bug in JIRA, but we didn't previously document it as a known issue; we documented the feature in the API reference and added a note to indicate that it's not supported in the current version.
(20.12.17) In consultation with Adi, I decided to document this as an enhancement in the v1.5.0 release notes.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Changed the behavior of the <api>Seek</api> operation's get-latest-location option (`Type=LATEST`) to return the location of the end of the shard instead of the location of the latest ingested record.


    {{< internal-release-note ig="5362" type="bug" docig="5833" owner="Ortal (ortall)" >}}
(sharonl) Orit said that we changed the behavior to conform to the Amazon Kinesis streaming API.
If the returned end-of-shard location is then passed to <api>GetRecords</api> before new records are added to the shard, the request succeeds but no records are returned and the <paramname>NextLocation</paramname> in the response is identical to the <paramname>Location</paramname> provided in the request (the end of the shard).
It's no longer possible to get the location of the last record in the shard.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}NoSQL Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

- <a id="update-expressions-nosql-web-api-changes"></a>
    Replaced the <api>UpdateItem</api> operation's <paramname>UpdateMode</paramname> and <paramname>Item</paramname> request parameters with an <paramname>UpdateExpression</paramname> parameter to support [update expressions](#update-expressions).

    {{< internal-release-note type="req" >}}
See the information for the [update-expressions](#update-expressions) new feature.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Scala APIs{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}NoSQL Scala API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

- <a id="update-expressions-nosql-scala-api-changes"></a>
    Added a <api>KeyValueOperations</api> <func>update</func> method that receives an <paramname>expression</paramname> parameter to support [update expressions](#update-expressions).

    {{< internal-release-note docig="5994" type="req" >}}
<br/>
See the information for the [update-expressions](#update-expressions) new feature.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="V3IOPath"></a>
    Added a <api>V3IOPath</api> class for getting an absolute v3io path to a file or directory within a specific data container.

    {{< internal-release-note type="req" docig="5994" owner="Golan (gshatz)" >}}
(sharonl) I couldn't located a JIRA issue for these changes, or for the addition of the <api>KeyValueOperations.update</api> <paramname>expression</paramname> parameter (see the previous note); Golan and Liat didn't know.

(31.12.17) It was agreed with Adi not to mention in the release notes that this type was added to handle a previous bug when not using the default container, nor that this type is temporary and is planned to be replaced with a URI in the next release.
Per Golan's request, I noted in the <api>V3IOPath</api> API-reference documentation that in future versions it's expected to be replaced with a table-path URI string.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Platform Management{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Added major and critical email alerts when the platform capacity exceeds 70% and 90%, respectively.
    Upon reaching critical capacity (&gt;&nbsp;90%), the platform state changes to offline mode ("closed gates").

    {{< internal-release-note type="req" id="ig-4482" >}}
**Requirement:** {{< jira ig="4482" >}}<br/>
**Owner:** Oded (odedm)<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) The intention is to increase the 90% critical-capacity threshold (ideally to 99%), but this task was deferred (see Bug {{< jira ig="5407" >}}, which was closed as _Won't Fix_).
Adi decided not to document the current 90% critical-capacity threshold as a known issue in the RNs.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Changed the number of the dashboard port, which is used for sending Management API requests, from 4001 to 8001.

    {{< internal-release-note docig="6000" type="req" owner="Oded (odedm)" >}}
**Internal Reference:** Confluence [Platform Port Usage](http://confluence.iguazeng.com:8090/display/PLAT/Platform+Port+Usage) page<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) Oded told me that there was no R&D JIRA issue for this change.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Dashboard (UI){{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Revamped the dashboard (UI) to provide an improved look and feel.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4239" type="req" owner="Eran N. (erann)" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- //////////////////////////////////////// -->
<!-- Fixes -->
{{< rn-heading t="fixes" >}}

The following issues were fixed in the current release:
{{< comment >}}<!-- [IntInfo] (27.3.18) The preface text above was added after
  the publication of the RNs, for better clarity and consistency with newer RNs
  (starting from the v1.5.3 RNs). -->
{{< /comment >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}General{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

-	Authorization failure may result in response status code 500 instead of 400.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3478" type="bug" owner="Vadim (vadimk)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

{{< rn-heading-small >}}Platform Management{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}Container Management API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	Container names (set in <api>Create Container</api>) cannot start with a numeric digit.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3671" type="bug" owner="Oded (odedm) / Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3671" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	List Containers may hang when there are no containers in the platform.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3204" type="bug" owner="Yuval N. (yuvaln)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Dashboard (UI){{< /rn-heading-small >}}

-	Spaces in the name of a container directory may cause a browse error.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3479" type="bug" owner="Eran N. (erann)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3479" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- //////////////////////////////////////// -->
<!-- Known Issues -->
{{< rn-heading t="known-issues" >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}General{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- [CDH](https://www.cloudera.com/products/open-source/apache-hadoop/key-cdh-components.html), Cloudera's Hadoop distribution, isn't supported.
    This issue will be fixed in a future release.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4253" type="req" owner="Evgeny (evgenyr)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (21.1.18) I understood from Orit and Yoav that we supported CDH in v1.0.x and we mentioned it in the product data sheets that we show customers, and we also mention it in the v1.5.0 data sheets even though it's not supported in v.1.5.0.
Requirement {{< jira ig="4253" >}} "CDH 5.13 (with SPARK 2.1)" is currently planned for the next v1.5.x maintenance release (`1.5.X_next_maintenance_release`).
In consultation with Yoav and Meir, we indicated explicitly that this will be fixed in a future release.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Automated system-failure recovery for ingested stream records or for data appended to a simple object might result in data duplication.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4887" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Condition and Update Expressions{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Division of an unsigned integer by a negative integer always returns zero.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5993" type="task" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" id="ig-5993-uint-division" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) {{< jira ig="5993" >}} also covers another issue &mdash; an "unreadable" (though correct) result when subtracting a `uint` value by another `uint` value.
(23.1.18) Orit said not to add a RN known issue for this.
See additional info in Task IG-5993.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Assignment of a Boolean value in an update expression using the `true` or `false` keyword causes a 400 error.
    Note that assigning an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value, such as `NOT false` instead of `true`, works correctly.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6111" type="bug" docig="6394" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (24.1.18) The bug was resolved on the v1.7.0 branch.
Gilad said he'll also merge it to `1.5.X_next_maintenance_release`.
(I'm not sure whether this would be for v1.5.1 or only for v1.5.2.)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Web APIs{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}Simple-Object Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	The <api>GET Service</api> operation for listing containers may sometimes return the container ID in place of the container name.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3027" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3027" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (29.1.18) In the initial v1.0.0 RNs, this was incorrectly documented as a Container Management API <api>List Containers</api> bug.
When preparing the v1.5.0 RNs, I found that the bug is in our <api>GET Service</api> AWS S3-equivalent web-API operation, so I also retroactively edited the v1.0.0 RN in the new web documentation.
<br/>
Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made; (this isn't planned for v1.5 or v1.7).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <api>GET Object</api> and <api>HEAD Object</api> operations don't return correct `ETag` and `Content-Type` metadata, and <api>GET Object</api> also doesn't return the correct `Last-Modified` metadata.

    {{< internal-release-note >}}
**Bugs:** {{< jira ig="3451" >}}; {{< jira ig="3453" >}} (ETag)<br/>
**Owner:** Gilad (giladb)<br/>
Known issue since RN v1.0.0 (`ETag` &mdash; RN phrased differently) and v1.5.0 (the rest, although the bugs probably also exist in earlier releases)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}Streaming Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	<api>PutRecords</api> with a stream path that points to an existing non-stream directory returns error <api>ResourceNotFoundException</api> instead of <api>ResourceIsnotStream</api>.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4310" owner="Ortal (ortall)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>UpdateStream</api> with an invalid request-body JSON format may not return the expected <api>InvalidArgumentException</api> error.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4310" owner="Ortal (ortall)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <api>DescribeStream</api> returns stream metadata regardless of the user's access permissions.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5841" type="bug" owner="Tal (taln)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
(sharonl) (8.1.18) The bug occurs also with our Scala/Java Streaming API &mdash; <api>V3IOStreamingOperations.describeStream</api>, defined in <path>v3io-streaming/src/main/scala/io/iguaz/v3io/streaming/V3IOStreamingOperations.scala</path> in the `zeta` repo.
However, at Golan's request, this API is not documented or mentioned in the release notes until we align our APIs, which is planned for v1.7.0, so I restricted the v1.5.0 known issue to the documented <api>DescribeStream</api> web operation.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}NoSQL Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	Requests with long filter expressions may fail.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3078" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3078" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>PutItem</api> requests with an item that contains unnamed attributes succeed.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="2423" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>PutItem</api> requests with a very large <paramname>Key</paramname> attribute value may result in response status code 500 instead of 400.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3597" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	Object (item) size restrictions  &mdash;

    - Each attribute must be smaller than 64 KB.

    - The total size of all attributes whose size is smaller or equal to 200 bytes cannot exceed 8 KB.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="2498" type="bug" owner="Alex (alext)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- When setting an item's primary key using <paramname>Key</paramname> request parameter of the <api>PutItem</api> or <api>UpdateItem</api> operation, you cannot define a user attribute with the same name (even if the value is the same).
    Note that when using the <paramname>Key</paramname> parameter, the platform automatically creates a matching user attribute for you.
    If you wish to create the attribute yourself, pass the item's name (primary key) in the request URL instead of using the JSON <paramname>Key</paramname> parameter.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="2068" type="bug" docig="5730" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) Orit wanted to document this as a known issue, even though we also explain this in the API reference.
This issue also exists in earlier releases but was not mentioned in previous release notes.

<br/>
(sharonl) The bug was resolved for v1.5.0 and then reopened.
There's an open discussion in the bug comments whether this is actually a bug and what should be the correct behavior.
(23.1.18) Orit said to keep the RNs known issue as-is.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- The performance statistics for multi-node clusters are inaccurate.

(sharonl) (21.1.18) The bug is currently resolved as Fixed on the next v1.5.x maintenance branch &mdash; `1.5.X_next_maintenance_release`.
Liat requested that we include this as a known issue in the v1.5.0 release notes.
<br/>
(20.2.18) The bug was reopened. The target version is currently v1.5.2.

(sharonl) (30.1.18) In the initial version of the v1.5.0 release notes, we documented this as a fixed issue because Bug 3110 was closed.
However, it was later established that the bug was closed by mistake and this is still an issue in v1.5.0, so at Maor's request (approved by Adi) I edited the RNs to move this back to the known issues.
