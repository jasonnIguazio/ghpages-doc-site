{{< rn-heading t="new-and-enhance" >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Presto {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Improved the performance of Presto queries.

<!-- //////////////////////////////////////// -->
<!-- Known Issues -->
{{< rn-heading t="known-issues" >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}General{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Automated system-failure recovery for ingested stream records or for data appended to a simple object might result in data duplication.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4887" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Backup and Recovery{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Stream data is not backed up and restored as part of the platform's backup and upgrade operations.

    {{< internal-release-note ki_start_ver="1.5.1" >}}
(13.2.18) Adi requested that we document this as a known issue in the RNs even though this behavior is by design and currently there's no plan to change it.
This will also be documented in the software specifications and restrictions document (DOC Task {{< jira ig="3582" >}}).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Presto {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- The <cmd>SHOW TABLES</cmd> command may hang for large tables.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6497" type="bug" owner="Dina (dinan)" ki_start_ver="1.5.1" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) Adi said to document only the Presto issue, as originally reported in the bug, and not mention the underlying nginx issue raised in the bug.
<br/>
(22.2.18) Adi decided to keep this known issue even though Meir says that <cmd>SHOW TABLES</cmd> (and <cmd>SHOW SCHEMAS</cmd>) aren't currently supported and shouldn't be used by customers.
(Nir confirmed that <cmd>SHOW TABLES</cmd> works, subject to the known large-tables issue.)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Condition and Update Expressions{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- Division of an unsigned integer by a negative integer always returns zero.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5993" type="task" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" fixver="1.5.3" id="ig-5993-uint-division" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (23.1.18) It was decided, in consultation with Orit and Adi, not to document other `uint` conversion issues in the v1.5.0 RNs.
(22.2.18) All issues have been fixed on the `development` branch (v1.7.0) and on branch `integ_v1.5`) but not on branch `integ_v1.5.1` (v1.5.1).
(19.3.18) Maor said that the fix isn't included in v1.5.2.
&ndash;&gt; I kept the division known issue from v1.5.0 in the v1.5.1 and v1.5.2 RNs and didn't add other known issues.
In the v1.5.3 RNs we'll move the known issue to the Fixes section.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- Assignment of a Boolean value in an update expression using the `true` or `false` keyword causes a 400 error.
    Note that assigning an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value, such as `NOT false` instead of `true`, works correctly.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6111" type="bug" docig="6394" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" fixver="1.5.3" id="ig-6111" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (21.2.18) The bug was resolved on the v1.7.0 branch and the fix was merged to branch `integ_v1.5`.
The fix wasn't merged to the v1.5.1 branch `integ_v1.5.1`.
(19.3.18) Maor said that the fix isn't included in v1.5.2.
(See DOC Task {{< jira ig="6729" >}} to update the documentation for v1.5.3.)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- The use of parentheses is sometimes required to ensure the correct operator precedence in an expression.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6601" type="bug" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.5.1" fixver="1.5.3" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (20.2.18) The bug existed also before v1.5.1 but we only became aware of it in that version when R&D realized that the operator precedence order in expressions was never specifically tested.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- In Spark DataFrame and Presto ({{< techpreview fmt="0" >}}) queries, the `IN` operator is supported only for columns of type string. 

    {{< internal-release-note ig="5718" type="bug" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.5.1" fixver="1.5.3" id="ig-5718" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (28.2.18) There's a bug with `IN` support for numeric operands when using AST filters.
This affects both Spark DF and Presto "expressions" (using the supported statement syntax for these languages) &mdash; because we translate these expressions to AST filters &mdash; and our NoSQL Scala/Python APIs when defining expressions using an AST filter.
I didn't mention the NoSQL API because we intentionally didn't document the option to define expressions using an AST filter (only using a string, which  works).
<br/>
We have been aware of this bug at least since v1.5.0, but it wasn't initially added to the RNs because we weren't aware of the Spark DF and Presto implications.
At Adi's request, I've now added this known issue retroactively to the v1.5.1 RNs.
<br/>
I decided to document this known issue in the expressions section to avoid duplication.
I also documented it in the v1.5.0+ SW specifications & restrictions doc.

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
{{< rn-heading-small >}}Web APIs{{< /rn-heading-small >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}Simple-Object Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	The <api>GET Service</api> operation for listing containers may sometimes return the container ID in place of the container name.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3027" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3027" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made; (this isn't planned for v1.5 or v1.7).
<br/>
(24.2.18) After speaking with Gilad, it turns out that we now have v1.7.0 Task {{< jira ig="5346" >}} **"eliminate container handle semantics in v3io ..."** for supporting only container names and removing the support for container IDs (handles).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}
    {{< comment >}}<!-- (sharonl) (29.1.18) In the initial v1.0.0 RNs, this was
      incorrectly documented as a Container Management API List Containers bug.
      When preparing the v1.5.0 RNs, I found that the bug is in our GET Service
      AWS S3-equivalent web-API operation, so I also retroactively edited the
      v1.0.0 RN in the new web documentation. -->
    {{< /comment >}}

- <api>GET Object</api> and <api>HEAD Object</api> operations don't return correct `ETag` and `Content-Type` metadata, and <api>GET Object</api> also doesn't return the correct `Last-Modified` metadata.

    {{< internal-release-note >}}
**Bugs:** {{< jira ig="3451" >}}; {{< jira ig="3453" >}} (ETag)<br/>
**Owner:** Gilad (giladb)<br/>
Known issue since RN v1.0.0 (`ETag` &mdash; RN phrased differently) and v1.5.0 (the rest, although the bugs probably also exist in earlier releases)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}Streaming Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	<api>PutRecords</api> with a stream path that points to an existing non-stream directory returns error <api>ResourceNotFoundException</api> instead of <api>ResourceIsnotStream</api>.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4310" owner="Ortal (ortall)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>UpdateStream</api> with an invalid request-body JSON format may not return the expected <api>InvalidArgumentException</api> error.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4310" owner="Ortal (ortall)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <api>DescribeStream</api> returns stream metadata regardless of the user's access permissions.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4021" type="bug" owner="Tal (taln)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
(sharonl) The v1.5.0 known issue was added for Bug {{< jira ig="5841" >}} "DescribeStream on stream that I don't have permissions to, returning data about the stream".
On 20.2.18, Bug IG-5841 was closed as a duplicate of Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}} "getAttr permission should change".
==> I duplicated the v1.5.0 known issue for Bug IG-5841 bug changed the main JIRA info to Bug IG-4021, and I updated the RNs info in the bugs accordingly.
<br/><br/>
(8.1.18) The bug occurs also with our Scala/Java Streaming API &mdash; <api>V3IOStreamingOperations.describeStream</api>, defined in <path>v3io-streaming/src/main/scala/io/iguaz/v3io/streaming/V3IOStreamingOperations.scala</path> in the `zeta` repo.
However, at Golan's request, this API is not documented or mentioned in the release notes until we align our APIs, which is planned for v1.7.0, so I restricted the v1.5.x known issue to the documented <api>DescribeStream</api> web operation.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}NoSQL Web API{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

-	Requests with long filter expressions may fail.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3078" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3078" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>PutItem</api> requests with an item that contains unnamed attributes succeed.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="2423" owner="Gal S. (gals)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>PutItem</api> requests with a very large <paramname>Key</paramname> attribute value may result in response status code 500 instead of 400.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3597" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	Object (item) size restrictions  &mdash;

    - Each attribute must be smaller than 64 KB.

    - The total size of all attributes whose size is smaller or equal to 200 bytes cannot exceed 8 KB.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="2498" type="bug" owner="Alex (alext)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- When setting an item's primary key using <paramname>Key</paramname> request parameter of the <api>PutItem</api> or <api>UpdateItem</api> operation, you cannot define a user attribute with the same name (even if the value is the same).
    Note that when using the <paramname>Key</paramname> parameter, the platform automatically creates a matching user attribute for you.
    If you wish to create the attribute yourself, pass the item's name (primary key) in the request URL instead of using the JSON <paramname>Key</paramname> parameter.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="2068" type="bug" docig="5730" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) Orit wanted to document this as a known issue, even though we also explain this in the API reference.
This issue also exists in earlier releases but was not mentioned in previous release notes.

{{< rn-heading-small-sub >}}Spark Streaming{{< /rn-heading-small-sub >}}

- To perform more than one action on the stream data, you must first cache the RDD.
    Note that this is the recommended practice in Spark Streaming.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3106" type="bug" owner="Tal (taln)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
<br/>
(24.12.17) Golan indicated in a [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-3106?focusedCommentId=24374&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-24374) in Bug 3106 that this bug will not be fixed in v1.5.0.
The target fix version is currently v1.7.0.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4140" type="bug" ki_start_ver="0.12.7" owner="Orit (oritn)" id="ig-4140" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) The bug was resolved for v1.5.0 and then reopened.
There's an open discussion in the bug comments whether this is actually a bug and what should be the correct behavior.
(23.1.18) Orit said to keep the RNs known issue as-is.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- The performance statistics for multi-node clusters are inaccurate.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="6158" type="bug" owner="Oded (odedm)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (21.1.18) Liat requested that we include this as a known issue in the v1.5.0 release notes.
(20.2.18) The bug was reopened after having been resolved as fixed for `1.5.X_next_maintenance_release`.
(19.3.18) The target version is currently v1.7.0.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	Opening a large file in the <gui-title>Browse</gui-title> view may cause the dashboard to hang.
