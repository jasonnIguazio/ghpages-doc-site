  At least some features were tested and approved by QA, but Ori asked not to officially support them for v1.9.
  Note that official-support decisions also affect the doc plan, as Tech Preview features are usually at the end of the tasks list and I rarely get to them.
  ==&gt; we should at least plan to check this for the next release, especially TSDB relies on arrays and blobs and is officially supported in v2.0.

**Confluence"** [Support Matrix](http://confluence.iguazeng.com:8090/display/SR/Support+Matrix)
{{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-managed-services-with-kubernetes"></a>Moved to using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) (k8s) (version 1.12.3) to deploy, scale, and manage both built-in and integrated application services and to enable users to easily manage services from the platform dashboard; (see also the related [dashboard enhancements](#new-ui-services-page)).

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-9110-8910-kubernetes" >}}
**Requirements:** {{< jira ig="9110" >}} (v2.0.0 k8s); {{< jira ig="8910" >}} (managed services); {{< jira ig="9170" >}} (services &mdash; UI) <br/>

    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-jupyter"></a>Added support for creating **Jupyter Notebook** services that use the preinstalled [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) web-based user interface (version 0.35.2) &mdash; including the integrated bash terminals and the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) web-based notebook for interactive computing (v5.7.4) with platform tutorial notebooks. {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}

    {{< internal-release-note ig="10075" type="subreq" req="7750" owner="Golan S. (golans)" docig="10216" id="ig-10075" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-grafana-service-changes"></a>Added official support for **Grafana** (previously supported as, raised the preinstalled version to version 5.4.2, and added support for creating Grafana user services for defining real-time dashboards that monitor and visualize data in the platform. {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}})

    {{< internal-release-note ig="10606" type="subreq" req="7750" owner="Felix G. (felixg)" docig="10215" id="ig-10606" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-frames"></a>Introduced **[V3IO Frames](https://github.com/v3io/frames)** &mdash; an open-source library, developed by Iguazio, which provides a single high-performance API for accessing NoSQL, stream, and time-series (TSDB) data in the platform's data container.
  Platform users can create V3IO Frames services that use the preinstalled version of this library (version 0.4.3). {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}

    {{< internal-release-note ig="10298" type="subreq" req="7750" owner="Golan S. (golans)" docig="10680" id="ig-10298" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-web-shell"></a>Added support for creating **web-based shell** services, which provide a command-line shell for running application services, such as Spark jobs and Presto queries, and performing basic file-system operations.

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-7750-web-shell" >}}
**Requirement:** {{< jira ig="7750" >}}<br/>
**Owner:** Eliran B. (eliranb)<br/>
**DOC Issue:** {{< jira ig="10843" >}} (managed services); {{< jira ig="9653" >}} (services &mdash; UI); {{< jira ig="10215" >}} (v2.0.0 support-matrix update)
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-log-forwarder"></a>Added a pre-deployed **log-forwarder** service that forwards application-service logs to be stored and indexed in an instance of the Elasticsearch search and analytics engine.
    The predefined service is disabled by default, as it requires the user to configure the Elasticsearch URL.

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-9167" >}}
**Requirement:** {{< jira ig="9167" >}}<br/>
**Sub-Requirement** for Requirement {{< jira ig="9110" >}} (v2.0.0 k8s): {{< jira ig="9139" >}}<br/>
**Owner:** Golan S. (golans)<br/>
**DOC Issue:** {{< jira ig="9665" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-users-container"></a>Added a new predefined "users" container, which is designed to provide individual user development environments and is used by the platform to manage the application services.
  <br/>
  When creating a new web-based shell, Jupyter Notebook, or Zeppelin service (see the [managed application-services](#new-managed-app-services) enhancements), a <dirname>&lt;username&gt;</dirname> directory with service configuration files is automatically created in this container for the service's running user.
  For the Jupyter Notebook service, this directory also contains the pre-deployed platform notebooks.

    {{< internal-release-note docig="10843" id="internal-new-users-container" >}}
(sharonl) (7.3.19) I didn't find a v2.0.0 JIRA requirement for this change, and I don't currently have a dedicated DOC task to document it.

(sharonl) (11.3.19) In v2.0.0, the "users" container must not be deleted, because it contains application data.
Also, deleting the user directory that's auto-generated by the shell, Jupyter, or Zeppelin service or any of the auto-generated files will cause the service to stop working.
I documented this in the **Software Specifications and Restrictions** spec page and in the **Data Containers, Collections, and Objects** concepts page.
See the related v2.2.0 Requirement {{< jira ig="11076" >}} (UI) and Sub-Task {{< jira ig="11271" >}} (Platform backend) to prevent the deletion of the "users" container.

{{< rn-heading h="4" id="new-web-apis" text="Web APIs" >}}

- <a id="new-web-api-X-v3io-transaction-verifier-response-header-w-last-modified-time"></a>Added an <api>X-v3io-transaction-verifier</api> response header with the last modification time (<api>\_\_mtime_secs</api> and <api>\_\_mtime_nsecs</api> system attributes) to single-object operations:

    - Simple-Object Web API (object modification time) &mdash; <api>GET Object</api>, <api>PUT Object</api>, <api>POST Object</api>, <api>HEAD Object</api>
    - Streaming Web API (stream-shard modification time) &mdash; <api>GetRecords</api>, <api>Seek</api>

<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
{{< rn-heading h="5" id="new-nosql-web-api" text="NoSQL Web API" >}}

- <a id="new-spark-nosql-df-range-scan"></a>Added official support for faster range-scan queries (previously supported as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}}).

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-5123" >}}
**Requirement:** {{< jira ig="5123" >}} (v1.7 web-API range-scan {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} support, verified by QA only for 1.9 bug officially supported only from v2.0.0)<br/>
**Owner:** Ori M. (orim)<br/>
**DOC Issue:** {{< jira ig="9215" >}} (v2.0.0 official range-scan support)<br/>
<br/>
See also the similar [Presto](#new-presto-range-scan-) and [Spark NoSQL DataFrame](#new-spark-nosql-df-range-scan) range-scan enhancements.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-nosql-web-api-scan-container-root-dir"></a>Added support for scanning a container's root directory by sending a <api>GetItems</api> request without a table path; the <paramname>TableName</paramname> request parameter is now optional.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="9102" type="req" owner="Oratl L. (ortall)" docig="6636" id="ig-9102" >}}
(sharonl) (10.3.19) In v2.0.0, we modified and enhanced the previously undocumented options to scan a container's root directory or recursively scan an entire container.
Because the previous non-table-specific container scan options weren't documented,we can simply document the current implementation as an enhancement.
<br/>
<api>GetItems</api> now supports omitting the table-path request parameter (provided in the URL or in the <paramname>TableName</paramname> JSON data parameter):

- If no table path is provided, or if the <paramname>TableName</paramname> parameter is set to `/`, the operation scans the container's root directory; the scan isn't recursive and applies only to files/items found directly under this directory.
  This option is documented.
- If the <parameter>TableName</parameter> JSON parameter is set to `/*`, the entire container is scanned recursively (including files in the root directory and in all nested directories).
  Ortal said this option was added mainly for internal use (to support backup and recovery) and that she's not sure we want to document it.
  I asked Orit about this in [IG-9102](#https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-9102?focusedCommentId=44707&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-44707) (no reply yet).
  (11.3.19) Adi confirmed that we shouldn't document this scan option.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="new-web-api-error-mssgs-imprv"></a>Improved the returned error messages.

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-4257-4138" >}}
**Requirements:** {{< jira ig="4257" >}}; {{< jira ig="4138" >}}<br/>
**Owner:** Roy B. (royb)<br/>
**DOC Issues:** Sub-Doc {{< jira ig="8122" >}}; Sub-Requirement {{< jira ig="10035" >}} for Requirement IG-4138 to review and write external error messages<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) (4.3.19) Adi approved adding the RN item despite the fact that neither requirement {{< jira ig="4257" >}} or {{< jira ig="4138" >}} is currently marked as tested; (the status of both requirements is _DONE_ and they both have QA labels).
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading h="4" id="new-presto" text="Presto" >}}

- <a id="new-presto-managed-k8s-service-n-ver-update"></a>Raised the preinstalled version of Presto to version 0.206 and provided a pre-deployed Presto service over Kubernetes, which is shared by all users with permissions to view services and can be managed from the dashboard; (see also the [k8s managed services](#new-managed-services-with-kubernetes) release note).

      notes. -->
    {{< /comment >}}

- <a id="new-presto-faster-item-specific-queries-for-IN-sharding-key"></a>Added support for faster item-specific queries with an "in" (`IN`) sharding-key filter (in addition to equal-to (`=`)).

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-9215-presto-faster-item-specific-queries-for-IN-sharding-key" >}}
**Owner:** Dina N. (dinan)<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) (4.3.19) Golan couldn't point to a JIRA ticket for this change, but both Golan and Dina confirmed that the change was done for v2.0.0.

**Bugs:** {{< jira ig="9352" >}} (`>`/`<=`); {{< jira ig="9391" >}} (`BETWEEN`)<br/>
**Owner:** Golan S. (golans)

(sharonl) (12.3.19) We added range-scan support for greater-than (`>`), less-than or equal-to (`<=`), and between (`BETWEEN`) sorting-key filters, in addition to equal-to (`=`), greater-than or equal-to (`>=`), and less-than (`<`) operators that were already supported.

- `[c-mgmt-apis-beta]` (sharonl) (11.3.19) These APIs were _tested by QA_.
  However, as we currently document all management APIs as Beta (because they weren't previously tested by QA), and we refrained from mentioning any changes to these APIs in previous release notes (last mentioned in the v1.0.0 RNs) and we don't currently have a list of tested management APIs, Adi approved keeping the Beta tag and ignoring the tested/Tech Preview distinctions in the release notes.

- (sharonl) (11.3.19) The Tenant-Statistics Management API's <api>Get Statistics</api> operation (<api>GET</api> on `/apis/tenants/[<tenant ID>/]statistics/`) also returns the storage-capacity quota, starting with v2.0.0, but not the thresholds.
According to Pavel, this was added to allow the UI to display the quota as part of the performance statistics, which was ultimately not implemented.
I confirmed with Adi and Oded that we don't need to mention this in the release notes or reference documentation.
<!-- [IntInfo] (sharonl) POST is done on /api/tenants/ to create a new

`[c-mgmt-apis-beta]` (sharonl) (11.3.19) This functionality wasn't tested by QA for v2.0.0, and therefore IG-6420 has the _"Tech Preview"_ requirement mode, but as explained for the [previous RN](#new-mgmt-tenant-api-quota), it was decided to continue documenting the management APIs as Beta APIs and therefore avoid {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} indications.

(18.6.18) The bug was resolved and closed as "Not a bug" because it was replaced with Requirement {{< jira ig="6348" >}} (currently planned for v1.7.0 bug marked as Cannot Fit).
Adi said to keep this known issue in the RNs until Requirement IG-6348 is handled and verified.
(30.8.18) IG-6348 was later canceled because it was determined to be a duplicate of Requirement {{< jira ig="5647" >}}, which is open without a target version.

(sharonl) Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made.

(24.2.18) After speaking with Gilad, it turns out that we now have v1.7.0 Task {{< jira ig="5346" >}} **"eliminate container handle semantics in v3io ..."** for supporting only container names and removing the support for container IDs (handles).

(sharonl) The v1.5.0 known issue was added for Bug {{< jira ig="5841" >}} "DescribeStream on stream that I don't have permissions to, returning data about the stream".
On 20.2.18, Bug IG-5841 was closed as a duplicate of Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}} "getAttr permission should change".
==&gt; I duplicated the v1.5.0 known issue for Bug IG-5841 bug changed the main JIRA info to Bug IG-4021, and I updated the RNs info in the bugs accordingly.
<br/><br/>
(8.1.18) The bug occurs also with our Scala/Java Streaming API &mdash; <api>V3IOStreamingOperations.describeStream</api>, defined in <path>v3io-streaming/src/main/scala/io/iguaz/v3io/streaming/V3IOStreamingOperations.scala</path> in the `zeta` repo.
However, at Golan's request, this API is not documented or mentioned in the release notes until we align our APIs, so I restricted the v1.5.x known issue to the documented <api>DescribeStream</api> web operation.
(The streaming API alignment is currently planned for v2.0.0.)
<br/>
(18.6.18) The bug was resolved as Fixed in v1.7.0 but the fix wasn't tested by QA.
Adi said to keep the known issue until the fix is verified.
(18.7.18) Still not fixed in v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA).
Ori said not to bother rephrasing the RN issue even if currently applicable to more than `DescribeStream` (I'm not sure).
<br/>
(27.2.19) I asked about the QA test plans and RN implications in a "V2.0.0 Release Notes" email from 19.2.19, and Meir replied that the QA is complicated and asked Orit and Ilan for prioritization.
I asked Orit for a decision in a [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-8784?focusedCommentId=44084&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-44084) in Bug IG-8784, in which I also copied Meir's email.
For now, I kept this as a known issue in the v2.0.0 RNs.

In v2.0.0, Bug IG-6246 was fixed and closed, but Bug IG-6475 is still open and was deferred to v2.4.0.
Roy B. and Ortal confirmed that the remaining known issue for Bug IG-6475 is only for the <api>GetItems</api> NoSQL Web API operation.

(sharonl) (20.3.19) Both bugs were fixed in v2.1.0.

This issue is related both to managed services and user management, and includes both a dashboard bug &mdash; the UI doesn't prevent the user deletion nor warn about its implications &mdash; and a Platform backend bug &mdash; allowing the deletion of such users; also, some of the issues with such deletions seem to be related to the fact that the backend doesn't actually delete the service pods for deleted services (which presents problems when creating users with names that were used in the past).
Because the trigger for the bug is the deletion of a user, I decided to include it in the user-management known issues.
