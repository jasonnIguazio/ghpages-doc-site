{{< rn-heading h="4" id="ki-presto-n-hive" text="Presto and Hive" >}}

- <a id="new-k8s-parquet-sql-queries-w-presto-n-hive"></a>Added support for running SQL queries using built-in Presto and [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) connectors, such as Parquet or ORC.
  Users can enable the Hive support from the custom parameters of the Presto service, and run SQL queries on the supported file formats from a Jupyter Notebook or web-shell service.
    {{< comment >}}<!-- [IntInfo] (sharonl) (13.6.19) I think the terminology
      here isn't accurate: I think there's a Hive connector for Presto that

      [c-presto-hive-connector-sup-file-types] in data/vars/presto.toml for a
      relevant reference to the Presto Hive connector doc. -->

<br/>
(sharonl) (30.5.19) Hive was already supported for vanilla installations; in v2.2.0, we added support for Hive in Kubernetes environments.
However, because we only plan to have Kubernetes customer installations and are documentation is restricted to Kubernetes, Adi asked that we don't specifically refer to Kubernetes in this note.
(3.6.19) Per Golan's request, I didn't refer specifically to the option to run the Presto CLI from a web shell or from a Jupyter terminal (even though it's possible and required for creating an external Hive table, for example); Golan explained that the focus here should be new feature of the support for the Presto support for additional file formats (data sources).

{{< rn-heading h="4" id="new-tsdb" text="Time-Series Databases (TSDBs)" >}}

<!-- ======================================== -->
{{< rn-heading h="4" id="new-grafana" text="Grafana" >}}

- <a id="new-grafana-iguazio-data-source-n-username-param"></a>Added an "iguazio" Grafana data source for accessing and visualizing data in the platform's data containers from a Grafana dashboard.
  This data source is defined only when the new optional username parameter of the Grafana service is set to a platform username, which will be used by the "iguazio" data source.

- <a id="new-cloud-log-forwarder-elasticsearch-on-cluster-cfg"></a>In cloud environments, improved the configuration of a local on-cluster Elasticsearch service for the log-forwarder service.

**DOC Issue:** {{< jira ig="11645" >}}<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) (2.6.19) In the v2.2.0 log-forwarder UI configuration, we replaced the <gui-label>Set URL for Cloud</gui-label> button &mdash; which was displayed also for bare-metal environments, which don't have an on-cluster Elasticsearch, and inserted the on-cluster Elasticsearch service URL in the Elasticsearch URL parameter &mdash; with an <gui-label> Elasticsearch</gui-label> parameter that's displayed only when there's an on-cluster Elasticsearch service and its value is a drop-down list with options <opt>None</opt> and the name of the on-cluster Elasticsearch services; we currently have a single on-cluster Elasticsearch service in cloud environments only.
When the <gui-label>Elasticsearch</gui-label> parameter is displayed and set to the name of an on-cluster Elasticsearch service, the <gui-label>Elasticsearch URL</gui-label> parameter is hidden.
I decided not to go into details in the release note, especially considering the guideline to downplay the on-cluster Elasticsearch option in the docs.

<br/>
(sharonl) Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made.
<br/>
(24.2.18) After speaking with Gilad, it turns out that we now have v1.7.0 Task {{< jira ig="5346" >}} **"eliminate container handle semantics in v3io ..."** for supporting only container names and removing the support for container IDs (handles).
<br/>
(25.5.20) {{< jira ig="5346" >}} was done in v2.2.0.
I confirmed with Assaf B. that **the bug doesn't exist since v2.2.0**.
However, as I missed this in the v2.2.0&ndash;2.5.0 release notes (because the KI was connected to Bug IG-3027 and not to Task IG-5346), it still appears (incorrectly) as a known issue in these release notes.
In the v2.8.0 release notes I removed this KI.
I didn't replace it with a fix note because the fix was done in v2.2.0.

(sharonl) (27.5.19) The Elasticsearch service can be created only in cloud environments; it uses the on-cluster Elasticsearch instance that's available only in the cloud environments.
In v2.2.0, attempting to delete an Elasticsearch service that's being used by a log-forwarder service returned an error (deployment error returned from the Platform backend and displayed in the UI), but the pods of the Elasticsearch service were deleted nonetheless.
The bug was fixed and closed in v2.3.0.
The fix was a backend fix to refrain from deleting the service pods when the service is in use.

<br/>
(sharonl) (26.2.19) In previous release notes we had a combined HA known issue for bugs {{< jira ig="6475" >}} and {{< jira ig="6246" >}}, phrased generically as "I/O requests might fail during failover.", per Ori's guideline (see, for example, the {{< xref s="release-notes" f="version-1.9/v1.9.5.md" a="ki-ha-io-requests-failure-ig-6475-6246" text="v1.9.5 RNs" >}}) and the details in the bugs' _Release Note Information_).
In v2.0.0, Bug IG-6246 was fixed and closed, but Bug IG-6475 is still open and was deferred to v2.4.0.
Roy B. and Ortal confirmed that the remaining known issue for Bug IG-6475 is only for the <api>GetItems</api> NoSQL Web API operation.
Therefore, I rephrased the known issue and created a {{< xref s="release-notes" f="version-2.0/v2.0.0.md" text="v2.0.0 release notes" a="fix-ha-io-stream-requests-failure-ig-6246" text="fix RN" >}} for Bug IG-6246.

<br/>
(sharonl) (30.8.18) In the v1.7.2 RNs, we connected the similar known issue to Bug {{< jira ig="8726" >}}, which has since then been resolved as a duplicate of Bug {{< jira ig="8733" >}}.
Therefore, I connected the v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) known issue to the open bug (IG-8733).
(24.4.19) But IG-8733 is still open but doesn't have a target version.
(Previously, it was planned for v2.0.0, which has since then been released).

(21.10.18) In the v1.7 RNs, internally we initially connected this known issue incorrectly to Bug {{< jira ig="7883" >}}.
We discovered the error when we prepared the v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) RNs, and Ori said that because there's no dedicated bug for this issue, we should connect the issue, for now, to the "KV for file system" Requirement {{< jira ig="5633" >}} &mdash; as implementing and integrating this solution is a prerequisite to resolving the known issue.

(sharonl) (29.5.19) This known issue replaces the previous known issue for Bug {{< jira ig="11031" >}} "[Services] make spark field mandatory for zeppelin", which was resolved and closed in 2.2.0 but the fix was only on the Platform backend side &mdash; return a relevant error (which is also displayed in the UI) when attempting to deploy a Zeppelin service without a Spark configuration.
Bug {{< jira ig="12076" >}} was opened today to enforce the Zeppelin service's Spark parameter requirement in the UI.
The bug is currently planned for v2.3.0.
I decided not to document a fix for the v2.1.0 (and earlier RNs known issue for Bug IG-11031), I just replaced that known issue with a UI specific issue.
<br/>
(4.6.19) UI But IG-12076 was resolved as fixed in v2.3.0, currently pending QA verification.

<br/>
(sharonl) (2.4.18) Adi requested that we add this in the release notes (starting with the v1.5.3 RNs, even though it's also true for earlier versions).
(20.3.19) At Maor's request, I rephrased the previous note to replace "restart, and shut-down" with "start-up and upgrade" (+ I added "actions"); Maor said that customers don't need to coordinate platform shutdowns.
