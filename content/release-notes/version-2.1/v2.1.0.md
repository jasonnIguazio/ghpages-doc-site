{{< comment >}}<!-- [c-v2.1-releases] [IntInfo] (sharonl) (24.4.19) V2.1.0 was
  released only for the cloud. The matching bare-metal release is v2.1.1, which
  has only a small bare-metal specific fix compared to v2.1.0. Adi decided to
  use v2.1.0 as the version number for both the bare-metal and cloud v2.1 GA
  release doc and to publish only v2.1.0 release notes (for all deployment
  types). See additional details in DOC IG-11612. -->

{{< internal-release-note title="Retroactive SATS Release-Notes Update" id="internal-retroactive-rns-update-SATS" >}}
On 20.5.19, we updated the release notes retroactively to add seven fix notes and one known-issue note for field bugs that were reported by SATS.
None of the bugs were documented as known issues in previous release notes or other external product documentation.
See the notes marked internally as `[c-retroactive-rns-update-SATS]` and the _Release Note Information_ field of the related bugs.
(We didn't make similar updates to the RNs-only PDF and HTML docs, which are available in the Iguazio documentation Dropbox folder and provided to customers upon request.)

  At least some features were tested and approved by QA, but Ori asked not to officially support them for v1.9.
  Note that official-support decisions also affect the doc plan, as Tech Preview features are usually at the end of the tasks list and I rarely get to them.
  ==&gt; we should at least plan to check this for the next release, especially TSDB relies on arrays and blobs and is officially supported in v2.0.

(20.5.19) The bug was fixed in v2.0.0, but because it wasn't previously documented as a known issue and we added the fix note specifically for SATS, who never used v2.0.0, it was decided (in consultation with Maor, Nir, and Orit) to add this retroactively to the v2.1.0 release notes (and not to the v2.0.0 release notes).

(20.5.19) Bug IG-11093 includes two issues &mdash; returning the internal name of the web-APIs service name ("nginx") and the service's version number in the HTTP responses.
The version was removed in v2.1.0 (per this fix release note), but the name is still returned, therefore the bug is still open; see the related [known-issue note](#ki-web-apis-service-name-in-http-responses) for the returned service name.
(21.5.19) The bug was resolved as fixed in v2.2.0.
<br/>
(21.5.19) Per Oded's input, "web-APIs service" isn't accurate in this context; the issue is with exposing information about the nginx web server (which our Web APIs Service uses).
It was agreed that as we already published the v2.1.0 RNs update and sent it to SATS, we won't rephrase the notes again to fix this inaccuracy.
We might rephrase the known issue when we document it as a fix in the v2.2.0 RNs.

-	The <api>GET Service</api> operation for listing containers may sometimes return the container ID in place of the container name.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3027" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3027" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made.
<br/>
(24.2.18) After speaking with Gilad, it turns out that we now have v1.7.0 Task {{< jira ig="5346" >}} **"eliminate container handle semantics in v3io ..."** for supporting only container names and removing the support for container IDs (handles).
(26.2.19) {{< jira ig="5346" >}} is still open and longer has a target version.

(sharonl) The v1.5.0 known issue was added for Bug {{< jira ig="5841" >}} "DescribeStream on stream that I don't have permissions to, returning data about the stream".
On 20.2.18, Bug IG-5841 was closed as a duplicate of Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}} "getAttr permission should change".
==&gt; I duplicated the v1.5.0 known issue for Bug IG-5841 bug changed the main JIRA info to Bug IG-4021, and I updated the RNs info in the bugs accordingly.
<br/><br/>
(8.1.18) The bug occurs also with our Scala/Java Streaming API &mdash; <api>V3IOStreamingOperations.describeStream</api>, defined in <path>v3io-streaming/src/main/scala/io/iguaz/v3io/streaming/V3IOStreamingOperations.scala</path> in the `zeta` repo.
However, at Golan's request, this API is not documented or mentioned in the release notes until we align our APIs, so I restricted the v1.5.x known issue to the documented <api>DescribeStream</api> web operation.
<br/>
(18.6.18) The bug was resolved as Fixed in v1.7.0 but the fix wasn't tested by QA.
Adi said to keep the known issue until the fix is verified.
(18.7.18) Still not fixed in v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA).
Ori said not to bother rephrasing the RN issue even if currently applicable to more than `DescribeStream` (I'm not sure).
<br/>
(27.2.19) I asked about the QA test plans and RN implications in a "V2.0.0 Release Notes" email from 19.2.19, and Meir replied that the QA is complicated and asked Orit and Ilan for prioritization.
I asked Orit for a decision in a [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-8784?focusedCommentId=44084&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-44084) in Bug IG-8784, in which I also copied Meir's email.
For now, I kept this as a known issue in the RNs.
<br/>
(26.5.19) The fix still hasn't been tested for v2.2.0.
Adi OKed removing the known issue from the new v2.2.0 RNs without replacing it with a fix note because of the missing QA tests.

(sharonl) (13.2.18) Adi requested that we document this as a known issue in the RNs even though this behavior is by design and currently there's no plan to change it.
This is also documented in the **Software Specifications and Restrictions** document (DOC Task {{< jira ig="3582" >}}).

(sharonl) This issue is also documented in the **"Software Specifications and Restrictions"** doc (`#duplicated-sys-failure-recovery-data`).
<br/>
(27.2.19) Bug {{< jira ig="7790" >}} has now been closed as _Won't Fix_.
Ori wrote in the comments "This is a know arch limitation of the system, at this point one can use the conditional update with the mtime returned on the command".
=&gt; I asked Adi, in a [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-7790?focusedCommentId=44092&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-44092) in Bug {{< jira ig="7790" >}}, whether this resolution requires any edits to the release-notes known issue and/or the SW restriction (namely, regarding the update-expression reference).
For now, I kept the doc as-is.

<br/>
(sharonl) (26.2.19) In previous release notes we had a combined HA known issue for bugs {{< jira ig="6475" >}} and {{< jira ig="6246" >}}, phrased generically as "I/O requests might fail during failover.", per Ori's guideline (see, for example, the {{< xref s="release-notes" f="version-1.9/v1.9.5.md" a="ki-ha-io-requests-failure-ig-6475-6246" text="v1.9.5 RNs" >}}) and the details in the bugs' _Release Note Information_).
In v2.0.0, Bug IG-6246 was fixed and closed, but Bug IG-6475 is still open and was deferred to v2.4.0.
Roy B. and Ortal confirmed that the remaining known issue for Bug IG-6475 is only for the <api>GetItems</api> NoSQL Web API operation.
Therefore, I rephrased the known issue and created a {{< xref s="release-notes" f="version-2.0/v2.0.0.md" text="v2.0.0 release notes" a="fix-ha-io-stream-requests-failure-ig-6246" text="fix RN" >}} for Bug IG-6246.

(sharonl) (30.8.18) In the v1.7.2 RNs, we connected the similar known issue to Bug {{< jira ig="8726" >}}, which has since then been resolved as a duplicate of Bug {{< jira ig="8733" >}}.
Therefore, I connected the v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) known issue to the open bug (IG-8733).
(24.4.19) But IG-8733 is still open but doesn't have a target version.
(Previously, it was planned for v2.0.0, which has since then been released).

(sharonl) (24.4.19) This bug was resolved as fixed in v2.0.0 but it's currently not marked as tested by QA.
I asked about the QA test plans and RN implications in a "V2.0.0 Release Notes" email from 19.2.19, and Meir replied that the QA is complicated and asked Orit and Ilan for prioritization.
I asked Orit for a decision in a [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-8784?focusedCommentId=44084&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-44084) in Bug IG-8784, in which I also copied Meir's email.
(28.4.19) I raised the issue of this known-issue documentation of a resolved bug (and similarly for Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}}) with Orit and Adi in a [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-8784?focusedCommentId=47233&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-47233) in Bug IG-8784.
Meir wrote in a [comment](https://jira.iguazeng.com/browse/IG-8784?focusedCommentId=47234&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-47234) in Bug IG-8783 that the fixes also won't be tested for v2.2.0.
For now, I kept this as a known issue in the RNs.
<br/>
(26.5.19) Adi OKed removing the known issue from the new v2.2.0 RNs without replacing it with a fix note because of the missing QA tests.

(21.10.18) In the v1.7 RNs, internally we initially connected this known issue incorrectly to Bug {{< jira ig="7883" >}}.
We discovered the error when we prepared the v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) RNs, and Ori said that because there's no dedicated bug for this issue, we should connect the issue, for now, to the "KV for file system" Requirement {{< jira ig="5633" >}} &mdash; as implementing and integrating this solution is a prerequisite to resolving the known issue.

(sharonl) (2.4.18) Adi requested that we add this in the release notes (starting with the v1.5.3 RNs, even though it's also true for earlier versions).
(20.3.19) At Maor's request, I rephrased the previous note to replace "restart, and shut-down" with "start-up and upgrade" (+ I added "actions"); Maor said that customers don't need to coordinate platform shutdowns.
