This document outlines the main additions and changes to the Iguazio Continuous Data Platform in version 1.9.4 (v1.9 GA release), and known issues in this version.

{{< techpreview note="1" >}}

{{< internal-release-note >}}
{{< note >}}
The RN labels for this release are mostly for v1.9.1 &mdash; `RN-1.9.1[-*]` &mdash; because it was only decided last minute to release v1.9.1, and later also v1.9.3, as RC releases for PickMe (v1.9.2 wasn't released), and release v1.9.4 as the v1.9 GA release.

<!-- Known Issues for Closed Bugs -->
{{< internal-release-note title="Known Issues for Closed Bugs" id="known-issues-for-closed-bugs" >}}
The bugs for the following known issues were resolved and closed as "Not a bug" or "Won't fix" but Adi wanted to keep the known issues for now:

- **[The bandwidth and IOPS container performance values are higher than the actual values for Simple-Object Web API <api>Get Object</api> operations.](#ki-ui-higher-bandwidth-n-ipos-container-perf-vals)** &mdash; dashboard (UI) Bug {{< jira ig="7776" >}}.
{{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- Untested RESOLVED/DONE Issues -->
{{< internal-release-note title="Untested RESOLVED/DONE Issues" id="doc-pending-qa-tests" >}}
The following issues are done by R&D but not tested by QA.
The issues are labeled in JIRA as `doc-pending-qa-tests` (query = [labels in (doc-pending-qa-tests)](https://jira.iguazeng.com/issues/?jql=labels in (doc-pending-qa-tests))).

- **Bugs resolved as Fixed** in v1.9.4 or in an earlier version, but the fix was **not verified by QA**.
  For now, **I _didn't_ replace the known issues with fix notes**.

    - **[<api>DescribeStream</api> returns info also for unauthorized users](#ki-describestream-perm-not-tested)** KI for Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}}.
      See also the open question regarding the description of this known issue and the recent comments from Meir and Orit.

- **Enhancements and new features** that **weren't tested by QA** and therefore **aren't included in the RNs** (not even as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}}):

  - {{< jira ig="5114" >}} &mdash; support **incremental backups**.

{{< rn-heading-small id="new-nuclio" >}}Nuclio (Serverless Functions) {{< techpreview mark="1" fmt="0" >}} {{< /rn-heading-small >}}

- <a id="new-nuclio-integration"></a> Integrated [Nuclio](https://nuclio.io/) (version 0.5.6) &mdash; Iguazio's open-source serverless framework for development and execution of auto-scaling applications &mdash; into the platform, on top of Kubernetes {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.
  Users with the new [Function Admin](#new-function-admin-mgmt-policy) management policy can use the Nuclio graphical dashboard from within the platform dashboard (see the new [<gui-title>Functions</gui-title>](#new-ui-nuclio) dashboard page).

    {{< internal-release-note id="ig-5116" >}}
**Requirements:** {{< jira ig="5116" >}} (v1.9.0) and {{< jira ig="8931" >}} (v1.9.1).<br/>
**Owner:** Eran D. (erand)<br/>
**DOC Issue:** {{< jira ig="7839" >}}<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) (6.9.18) The descriptions of v1.9.0 Requirement IG-5116 and v1.9.1 Requirement IG-8931 are similar.
In the other v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) RNs related to the Nuclio integration into the platform, I referred only to IG-5116.
<br/>
(16.9.18) Adi  decided not to mention the Kubernetes support in the v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) RNs other than in the Nuclio note.
See additional info in the Release Note Information for Requirement {{< jira ig="2997" >}}.
<br/>
(3.10.18) It was decided to remove the reference to the Nuclio CLI (**nuctl**) from this RN.
We plan to allow using this CLI on v1.9 platforms by downloading the CLI from the Nuclio GitHub and using it with a <file>kubeconfig</file> file that we'll provide at the end of platform installations (agreed with Adi, Lev, Nir, and Eliran), but as this won't be tested by QA and isn't required Adi decided not to mention it in the RNs.

- <a id="new-nosql-spark-df-range-scan-even-distribution"></a>Added a <opt>&quot;range-scan-even-distribution&quot;</opt> write option for optimizing storage of non-uniform data (where most of the data applies to only a few sharding keys) and shortening related query times with Spark DataFrames or Presto {{< techpreview mark="1" >}}.

(sharonl) (30.8.18) This bug was documented in the v1.0.0&ndash;v1.7.2 RNs as a known related to Bug {{< jira ig="3093" >}}, which was resolved in v1.9.0 because it was defined specifically for CDH, which isn't supported in v1.7 and v1.9.
The bug was fix in v1.9.0 by implementing Requirement {{< jira ig="5623" >}}.
==> I documented this as a fix in the current v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) RNs and removed the related restriction in the v1.9 SW restrictions & security documentation.

- <a id="fix-ui-container-perf-graphs-wrong-spikes"></a>The performance graphs in the container overview might display an incorrect spike in the following instances:

    - For the first data point in the graph when initially loading the display (before a periodic refresh occurs).
    - For all data points that are added to the display as a result of the periodic display refresh or when the user changes the display filter.
      Refreshing the display typically resolves the spike for the currently displayed data points.

<br/>
(sharonl) (18.7.18) This issue combines both Bug IG-8129, for the first-data point spike, and for additional related scenarios that Eran N. later discovered and aren't reflected in JIRA.
In the v1.7.0 Early Edition RNs we were only aware of Bug IG-8169 + Eran has now noted that the "temporarily" reference in that RN wasn't accurate because without a manual refresh the spike can remain displayed for a long time.
I therefore rephrased the known issue for the v1.7.1 RNs.
<br/>
(7.11.18) The bug was fixed in v1.9.0 and the fix was verified by QA in v1.9.4.
Dana confirmed that the fix is for both of the previous known-issues scenarios.

<br/>
(sharonl) Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made; (this isn't planned for v1.5 or v1.7).
<br/>
(24.2.18) After speaking with Gilad, it turns out that we now have v1.7.0 Task {{< jira ig="5346" >}} **"eliminate container handle semantics in v3io ..."** for supporting only container names and removing the support for container IDs (handles).
(30.8.18) {{< jira ig="5346" >}} is still planned for v1.7.0 with Status ICEBOX.

(sharonl) The v1.5.0 known issue was added for Bug {{< jira ig="5841" >}} "DescribeStream on stream that I don't have permissions to, returning data about the stream".
On 20.2.18, Bug IG-5841 was closed as a duplicate of Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}} "getAttr permission should change".
==> I duplicated the v1.5.0 known issue for Bug IG-5841 bug changed the main JIRA info to Bug IG-4021, and I updated the RNs info in the bugs accordingly.
<br/><br/>
(8.1.18) The bug occurs also with our Scala/Java Streaming API &mdash; <api>V3IOStreamingOperations.describeStream</api>, defined in <path>v3io-streaming/src/main/scala/io/iguaz/v3io/streaming/V3IOStreamingOperations.scala</path> in the `zeta` repo.
However, at Golan's request, this API is not documented or mentioned in the release notes until we align our APIs, so I restricted the v1.5.x known issue to the documented <api>DescribeStream</api> web operation.
(The streaming API alignment is currently planned for v2.0.0.)
<br/>
(18.6.18) The bug was resolved as Fixed in v1.7.0 but the fix wasn't tested by QA.
Adi said to keep the known issue until the fix is verified.
(18.7.18) Still not fixed in v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA).
Ori said not to bother rephrasing the RN issue even if currently applicable to more than `DescribeStream` (I'm not sure).
