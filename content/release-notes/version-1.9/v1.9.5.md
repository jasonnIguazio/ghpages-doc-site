  "reviewer" param from known-issues release notes that aren't moved to fixes
  (as existing known issues don't need to be reviewed again). -->
{{< /comment >}}

This document outlines the main additions and changes to the Iguazio Continuous Data Platform in version 1.9.5, and known issues in this version.

{{< techpreview note="1" >}}

{{< internal-release-note >}}
{{< note >}}
It was decided not to mention in the v1.9.5 release notes any requirements that were done in this release, only bug fixes; (IG-9562 is a bug fix in an API feature that was previously undocumented, so we documented it in the RNs as a new feature).

<!-- Known Issues for Closed Bugs -->
{{< internal-release-note title="Known Issues for Closed Bugs" id="known-issues-for-closed-bugs" >}}
The bugs for the following known issues were resolved and closed as "Not a bug" or "Won't fix" but Adi wanted to keep the known issues for now:

- **[The bandwidth and IOPS container performance values are higher than the actual values for Simple-Object Web API <api>Get Object</api> operations.](#ki-ui-higher-bandwidth-n-ipos-container-perf-vals)** &mdash; dashboard (UI) Bug {{< jira ig="7776" >}}.
{{< /internal-release-note >}}

<!-- Untested RESOLVED/DONE Issues -->
{{< internal-release-note title="Untested RESOLVED/DONE Issues" id="doc-pending-qa-tests" >}}
The following issues are done by R&D but not tested by QA.
The issues are labeled in JIRA as `doc-pending-qa-tests` (query = [labels in (doc-pending-qa-tests)](https://jira.iguazeng.com/issues/?jql=labels in (doc-pending-qa-tests))).

- **Bugs resolved as Fixed** in v1.9.5 or in an earlier version, but the fix was **not verified by QA**.
  For now, **I _didn't_ replace the known issues with fix notes**.

    - **[<api>DescribeStream</api> returns info also for unauthorized users](#ki-describestream-perm-not-tested)** KI for Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}}.
      See also the open question regarding the description of this known issue and the recent comments from Meir and Orit.

- **Enhancements and new features** that **weren't tested by QA** and therefore **aren't included in the RNs** (not even as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}}):

  - {{< jira ig="5114" >}} &mdash; support **incremental backups**.

    {{< internal-release-note ki_start_ver="1.5.1" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (13.2.18) Adi requested that we document this as a known issue in the RNs even though this behavior is by design and currently there's no plan to change it.
This is also documented in the software specifications and restrictions document (DOC Task {{< jira ig="3582" >}}).

Known issue since RN v1.7.0<br/>
<br/>
(sharonl) (20.6.18) Michael said that the bug applies to all relevant interfaces &mdash; our web and non-web (Scala, Python, etc.) APIs and Spark DataFrames.
Ori said that the bugs aren't specific to get-items and other NoSQL requests and put/get-records streaming requests, and that we should refer to "I/O requests" in general.

-	The <api>GET Service</api> operation for listing containers may sometimes return the container ID in place of the container name.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="3027" type="bug" owner="Gilad (giladb)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="ig-3027" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) Bug 3027 was closed in v1.5.0 as "Won't Fix".
(25.12.17) Gilad explained that it was closed because eventually (although we don't currently know in which version) we will change the design and only expose container names to the user, which will make this bug irrelevant, so it's not worth the fix effort.
Adi confirmed that we should continue documenting this as a known issue in the release notes until the relevant design changes are made; (this isn't planned for v1.5 or v1.7).
<br/>
(24.2.18) After speaking with Gilad, it turns out that we now have v1.7.0 Task {{< jira ig="5346" >}} **"eliminate container handle semantics in v3io ..."** for supporting only container names and removing the support for container IDs (handles).
(30.8.18) {{< jira ig="5346" >}} is still planned for v1.7.0 with Status ICEBOX.
I asked Liat and Gilad in the ticket comments, on 17.6.18 & 30.8.18, to re-plan it to a later version.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}
    {{< comment >}}<!-- (sharonl) (29.1.18) In the initial v1.0.0 RNs, this was
      incorrectly documented as a Container Management API List Containers bug.
      When preparing the v1.5.0 RNs, I found that the bug is in our GET Service
      AWS S3-equivalent web-API operation, so I also retroactively edited the
      v1.0.0 RN in the new web documentation. -->
    {{< /comment >}}

- <api>GET Object</api> and <api>HEAD Object</api> operations don't return correct `ETag` and `Content-Type` metadata, and <api>GET Object</api> also doesn't return the correct `Last-Modified` metadata.

**Bugs:** {{< jira ig="3451" >}}; {{< jira ig="3453" >}} (ETag)<br/>

Known issue since RN v1.0.0 (`ETag` &mdash; RN phrased differently) and v1.5.0 (the rest, although the bugs probably also exist in earlier releases)

-	<a id="ki-putrecords-for-non-stream-dir-error-ig-4310"></a><api>PutRecords</api> with a stream path that points to an existing non-stream directory returns error <api>ResourceNotFoundException</api> instead of <api>ResourceIsnotStream</api>.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4310" owner="Ortal (ortall)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

-	<api>UpdateStream</api> with an invalid request-body JSON format may not return the expected <api>InvalidArgumentException</api> error.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4310" owner="Ortal (ortall)" ki_start_ver="1.0.0" >}}
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

- <a id="ki-describestream-perm-not-tested"></a><api>DescribeStream</api> returns stream metadata regardless of the user's access permissions.

    {{< internal-release-note ig="4021" type="bug" owner="Tal (taln)" ki_start_ver="1.5.0" fixver="1.7.0" id="ig-4021" >}}
(sharonl) The v1.5.0 known issue was added for Bug {{< jira ig="5841" >}} "DescribeStream on stream that I don't have permissions to, returning data about the stream".
On 20.2.18, Bug IG-5841 was closed as a duplicate of Bug {{< jira ig="4021" >}} "getAttr permission should change".
==> I duplicated the v1.5.0 known issue for Bug IG-5841 bug changed the main JIRA info to Bug IG-4021, and I updated the RNs info in the bugs accordingly.
<br/><br/>
(8.1.18) The bug occurs also with our Scala/Java Streaming API &mdash; <api>V3IOStreamingOperations.describeStream</api>, defined in <path>v3io-streaming/src/main/scala/io/iguaz/v3io/streaming/V3IOStreamingOperations.scala</path> in the `zeta` repo.
However, at Golan's request, this API is not documented or mentioned in the release notes until we align our APIs, so I restricted the v1.5.x known issue to the documented <api>DescribeStream</api> web operation.
(The streaming API alignment is currently planned for v2.0.0.)
<br/>
(18.6.18) The bug was resolved as Fixed in v1.7.0 but the fix wasn't tested by QA.
Adi said to keep the known issue until the fix is verified.
(18.7.18) Still not fixed in v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA).
Ori said not to bother rephrasing the RN issue even if currently applicable to more than `DescribeStream` (I'm not sure).

<br/>
(sharonl) (16.9.18) I added the {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} indication because it was decided not to officially support range scan in the v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) release.
See the _Release Note Information_ for Requirement {{< jira ig="6885" >}}.
    {{< /internal-release-note >}}

{{< internal-release-note >}}
(31.1.19) I retroactively removed the following known issue, for Bug {{< jira ig="8516" >}}, from the v1.9.4 & v1.9.5 release notes because I couldn't reproduce it with v1.9.4 and Vadim (QA) confirmed that it was fixed in v2.0.0.
Adi and Golan approved the retroactive RNs update.

<br/>
(sharonl) The shard-count increase can currently be done only using the <api>UpdateStream</api> Streaming Web API operation.
<br/>
This bug exists also in earlier versions but was discovered only before the v1.5.3 release and the v1.5.0 documentation publication, and therefore added to the RNs only in v1.5.3 + added to the _Software Specifications and Restrictions_ and <api>UpdateStream</api> Streaming Web API reference documentation in v1.5.0 and retroactively also in the v1.0.3 reference &mdash; see DOC Task {{< jira ig="7157" >}}.

    {{< internal-release-note ki_start_ver="1.0.0" id="hdfs-unsupported-cmds" >}}
<br/>
(sharonl) (26.6.18) Initially, this known issue included the <cmd>truncate</cmd> command and was associated with Bug {{< jira ig="3106" >}} to implement this command.
Bug 3106 and duplicate Bug {{< jira ig="5239" >}} were resolved in v1.7.0 as {{< techpreview fmt="0" >}} (not tested by QA), at which point I documented the support for <cmd>truncate</cmd> as an [enhancement](#ig-3106), removed the reference to the command from the known-issue note, and disassociated the known-issue note from Bug 3106.
The changes were done after the initial publication of the v1.7.0 Equinix Early Edition release notes.

Golan said there's no JIRA ticket to support the other commands.

  Therefore, the user who submits the request must both be one of the named users and belong to one of the named groups.

<br/>
(sharonl) (7.11.18) Bug IG-7776 was resolved and closed as "Not a bug".
Shaked explained that for >=64K files, NGINX first have to send a `GET` request to get the file size and then another request to get the actual data, resulting in more IOPS operations than expected.
As NGINX have no alternatives, the bug was closed as "Not a bug".
I consulted Adi and he said to keep the RN known issue for now and we'll reconsider this later on.

(sharonl) This known issue was initially associated in the RNs and in JIRA with Bug {{<jira ig="4140" >}}, which was resolved for v1.5.0 and then reopened.
(18.6.18) The bug was resolved and closed as "Not a bug" because it was replaced with Requirement {{< jira ig="6348" >}} (currently planned for v1.7.0 bug marked as Cannot Fit).
Adi said to keep this known issue in the RNs until Requirement IG-6348 is handled and verified.
(30.8.18) IG-6348 was later canceled because it was determined to be a duplicate of Requirement {{< jira ig="5647" >}}, which is open without a target version.
==> I kept the known issue also in the v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) RNs and changed the association here and in JIRA to connect the RN known issue to IG-5647.

(21.10.18) In the v1.7 RNs, internally we initially connected this known issue incorrectly to Bug {{< jira ig="7883" >}}.
We discovered the error when we prepared the v1.9.4 (v1.9 GA) RNs, and Ori said that because there's no dedicated bug for this issue, we should connect the issue, for now, to the "KV for file system" Requirement {{< jira ig="5633" >}} &mdash; as implementing and integrating this solution is a prerequisite to resolving the known issue.

(sharonl) (18.7.18) (Based on info from Maor and Ori) Bug IG-7701 was fixed after the v1.7.0 Early Edition RNs for Equinix, which first mentioned it, and before the v1.7.1 (v1.7 GA) release, but it's currently not possible to test it.
(26.7.18) The bug was initially resolved as _Won't Fix_ but the resolution was later changed to _Fixed_.
Adi asked to keep the RN known issue until the fix is verified.
(8.10.18) The current bug status is _REOPENED_.
