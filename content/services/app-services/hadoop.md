The {{< product lc >}} provides a self-service and open-source {{< url g="hadoop" v="home" k="text" link="1" >}} framework that makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process and analyze vast amounts of data for operational, analytics, and data-engineering needs.
The {{< product lc >}}'s distributed file system (DFS) is an Hadoop Compatible File System (HCFS).
You can run Hadoop commands from any {{< product lc >}} command-line interface &mdash; such as a web-based shell, a Jupyter notebook or terminal, or a Zeppelin notebook &mdash; as demonstrated, for example, in the {{< xref f="data-layer/containers/working-with-containers.md" >}} tutorial and in the getting-started ingestion examples in the {{< product lc >}}'s {{< xref f="services/app-services/jupyter.md" text="Jupyter" >}} tutorial notebook.
