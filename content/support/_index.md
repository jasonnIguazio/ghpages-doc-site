{{< comment >}}<!-- [SITE-RESTRUCT] [c-faq] [IntInfo] (sharonl) (8.2.21) This
  section was added as part of the doc-site restructure. However, currently we
  don't have an FAQ yet - Nir (CS) can't provide a draft yet - and there's only
  one best-practice guide. => We moved the best-practice guide to the data-layer
  section and filtered out the section by using a future publication date and
  not adding a related side-menu section in config.toml + we use an "faq"
  filter to filter out relevant references.
  TODO: When we add FAQs [DOC IG-14359], remove the `faq` filter in config.toml
  or change its value to "true"; remove the filter uses (specifically if the
  filter definition is removed); remove the `publishDate` front-matter field
  for this page; uncomment the reference to the support/ section in the
  config.toml Params.Sections array; move the
  best-practices-primary-keys-n-workload-distribution.md doc from the
  data-layer/ section to this section and edit all xrefs to this page, or
  otherwise change the section title unless we add other best-practice guides;
  link to the support/ section from the doc-site home page (main _index.md),
  which already has the relevant code, currently filtered out with the "faq"
  filter. -->
