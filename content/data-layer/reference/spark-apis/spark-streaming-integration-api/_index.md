{{< comment >}}<!-- [SITE-RESTRUCT] This section replaces
  reference/api-reference/spark-apis/spark-streaming-integration-api/.
- [TODO-SITE-RESTRUCT-EXTERNAL-REFS] After the publication of the restructured
  site, replace the v3io/tutorials references to this doc (from
  data-ingestion-and-preparation/README.ipynb/.md). (Until then and for
  previous tutorials releases, we'll have URL redirect rules as part of the
  restructured-site publication.)
