{{< comment >}}<!-- [SITE-RESTRUCT] This section replaces reference/presto/.
- [TODO-SITE-RESTRUCT-P2] (sharonl) TODO: Separate reference and guide
  documentation and move no-NoSQL-specific guide documentation to
  data-layer/nosql/presto/. Remember to check both doc-site cross references
  and external references to the Presto documentation. 
- [TODO-SITE-RESTRUCT-EXTERNAL-REFS] After the publication of the restructured
  site, replace the v3io/tutorials references to this doc (from
  platform-overview.ipynb). (Until then and for previous tutorials releases,
  we'll have URL redirect rules as part of the restructured-site publication.)
