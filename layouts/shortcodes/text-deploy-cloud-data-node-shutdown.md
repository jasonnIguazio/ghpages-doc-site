<a id="data-node-shutdown-note"></a>The data-node instances include Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSD-based instance storage, which is optimized for low latency, very high random I/O performance, and high sequential read throughput.
The data doesn't persist on the NVMe if the instance is stopped.

**Don't attempt to shut down any of the data nodes, as it will erase the data.**
